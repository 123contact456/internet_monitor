		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this month, Russia’s new Internet censorship bill (available in English <a href="http://bit.ly/IM_Russia">here</a>, translated by Google machine translation) – designed to block content “containing [child] pornography or extremist ideas, or promoting suicide or use of drugs” – went into effect. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskomnadzor">Roskomnadzor</a>, the Russian government’s media and communication monitoring ministry, will be responsible for enforcing the blacklist, which will be generated by submissions from individual users as well as three government agencies: the Interior Ministry, the Federal Antidrug Agency and the Federal Service for the Supervision of Consumer Rights and Public Welfare.

According to the new bill, after Roskomnadzor adds a website to its blacklist, the host provider of the offending site must remove the content immediately or Internet service providers (ISPs) will be instructed to block traffic to that site, or even the entire hosting provider. In protest, Russian Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Wikipedia#Blackout">blocked access to its own content</a> for 24 hours in July, and major search engine Yandex, as well as sites like Mail.ru, Vkontakte and Livejournal, have all <a href="http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/russia-internet-censorship-97937">staged protest campaigns</a>. <a href="http://en.rsf.org/russia-freedom-of-information-threatened-13-07-2012,43019.html">Reporters Without Borders</a> has also condemned the bill.

Online free speech scholars and activists have cited two frequent concerns about the bill. The first is that the bill’s definition of <a href="http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.14/russian-bill-blacklist-websites">censorable content is vague, at best</a>. What begins as the blocking of objectionable or “extremist” ideas may <a href="http://en.rsf.org/russia-freedom-of-information-threatened-13-07-2012,43019.html">slowly expand</a>, encroaching on valuable political speech. Content creators may become warier of what they post online, spurring self-censorship. And entire host providers could be blocked for one offensive piece of content – e.g., <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/24/world/meast/iran-youtube-blocked/index.html">all of YouTube blocked</a> to prevent access to the recent anti-Islam film that sparked riots this summer. (The technical solution to prevent this from occurring leads to the second concern, below.) As Russia’s Communications and Press Minister Nikolai Nikiforov <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/internet-restriction-bill-passes-first-reading/461792.html">wrote on Twitter in July</a>: "The bill's idea related to protecting children from objectionable information is right, but there are problems with the mechanisms for doing so."

Second, the new system likely <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/11/russia-surveillance/all/">implements Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)</a> – a form of packet filtering that that examines both the header and the actual data of the information being transmitted between the user and the Internet. Essentially, the government will be able to create a detailed log of what content any user accesses online. Rather than just block particularly offensive content, a nationwide implementation of DPI could give the government the power to monitor anyone’s online activity.

Russian netizens – among them the creators of <a href="http://rublacklist.net/">Rublacklist.net</a>, a site created to document each website blocked in accordance with the bill – are watching closely to see whether this new law will be applied narrowly or broadly, and how it will ultimately affect the freedom of Russia’s Internet.

Already, one suicide prevention site that has a page listing suicide methods has been blocked, as has the Russian domain (though not a parallel, internationally hosted site) for the <a href="http://en.rylkov-fond.org/">Rylkov Foundation</a>, which promotes drug policies based on "humanity, tolerance, protection of health, dignity and human rights" – the foundation apparently supports substitution therapy in the treatment of drug addicts.

These efforts represent a broad shift in Russia’s approach to Internet censorship. In the OpenNet Initiative’s 2010 book <a href="http://access.opennet.net/controlled/">Access Controlled</a>, Ron Diebert and Rafal Rohozinski described the “<a href="http://oni-access.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/accesscontrolled-chapter-2.pdf">relative freedom</a>” on the Russian web and noted that technical tests had found the Russian Internet “<a href="http://oni-access.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/accesscontrolled-chapter-2.pdf">accessible and relatively free from ﬁltering</a>.” Compared to the technical filtering found in China, Russia’s “control strategies tend to be more subtle and sophisticated and designed to shape and affect when and how information is received by users, rather than denying access outright.”

Russia’s new law runs parallel to efforts in a number of countries around the world to require ISPs to invest in filtering technology, such as <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/opinion/docs/ROK-Pressstatement17052010.pdf">South Korea’s practices of arbitrarily requesting ISPs</a> to block information the government wants to suppress. Even in the United States, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), if enacted, would have required ISPs to block access to sites after a court order.

<a href="Rublacklist.net">Rublacklist.net</a> has put together a collection of ways to circumvent the black list. As in China and elsewhere, it seems probable that an escalating cat-and-mouse game will develop. For now, important questions about who decides what is filtered and how transparent and accountable the system will be remain up in the air.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Australia</strong>
Australian Internet users are wary of the government's <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-05/17/australia-internet-block">newly exposed ability</a> to block multiple websites without notice, revealed when the Australian Securities and Investment Commission <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/asics-accidental-block-exposes-secret-internet-filtering-scheme-7000015477/">accidentally filtered</a> over 1200 sites in an attempt to shut down a single website for fraud.  Among the accidentally blocked sites was that of community-based activist group Melbourne Free University, which documented its experience trying to obtain information about the shutdown in a <a href="<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/4694252.html">blog post</a>  .

<strong>Iran</strong>
In advance of Iran's upcoming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_presidential_election,_2013">presidential elections</a>, scheduled for June 14, 2013, Internet users <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/21/net-us-iran-election-internet-idUSBRE94K0ID20130521">are experiencing</a> slower speeds and trouble using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to access blocked sites.  The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324059704578471233256127050.html">reports</a> that most Internet cafés in the country have had to close due to service disruptions, and that a newly created "special election cyberunit" has been established to monitor social media surrounding the presidential race.  SMS service has also been <a href="http://www.ncr-iran.org/en/news/iran-protests/13691-sms-messages-cut-back-as-iran-s-rulers-fear-election-protest-mobilization.html">affected</a>.  Thus far, Iranian authorities are <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/05/2013519185216148974.html">denying</a> any involvement in the disruptions.

<strong>Syria</strong>
Syria's Internet has experienced multiple <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/08/syria-crisis-internet-idUSL6N0DP3T920130508">blackouts</a> this month as the country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war">internal conflict</a> continues.  On May 7, 2013, Renesys reported a <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2013/05/syrian-internet-fragility.shtml">complete Internet outage</a> lasting over 19 hours; Google also noted a <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/disruptions/82/">disruption</a> to all of the company's products in the country.  A <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/disruptions/84/">second outage</a>, lasting approximately eight hours, took place on May 15.  Cloudflare has a <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-syria-turned-off-the-internet-again">video explaining how</a> the shutdowns took place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A recent <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/censored.pdf">paper</a> from Harvard University researchers Gary King, Jennifer Pan, and Margaret E. Roberts contains a neat "censorship magnitude" graph showing which types of social media posts are most and least likely to be taken down by Chinese censors:

[caption id="attachment_49" align="aligncenter" width="584"]<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/05/Events-with-Highest-and-Lowest-Censorship-Magnitude.png"><img src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/05/Events-with-Highest-and-Lowest-Censorship-Magnitude-1024x662.png" alt="" title="Events-with-Highest-and-Lowest-Censorship-Magnitude" width="584" height="377" class="size-large wp-image-49" /></a> "Events with Highest and Lowest Censorship Magnitude," from <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/censored.pdf">How Censorship in China Allows Government Criticism but Silences Collective Expression</a>, by Gary King, Jennifer Pan, and Margaret E. Roberts[/caption]

By downloading over 3,600,000 social media posts from nearly 1400 blogs, forums, and microblogs, then revisiting the sites later to determine what kinds of content had been manually removed, King, Pan, and Roberts were able to conclude that Chinese government censorship tends to focus more intently on posts that call for collective action and social mobilization, rather than removing all posts critical of the government:

<blockquote>Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future—and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Cuba</strong>
The Cuban Internet has leveled up this year: in January, a <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/01/10/what-happened-to-the-cable-cubans-discuss-internet-access/">long-dormant</a> cable connection to Venezuela was <a href="http://www.renesys.com/2013/01/cuban-fiber-completo/">activated</a>, giving Cuba its first non-satellite connection to the global Internet.  Last week, a <a href="http://www.renesys.com/2013/05/cuba-jamaica-link-activated/">second cable connection</a>, this time to Jamaica, came online.  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/world/americas/cuban-centers-to-offer-a-costly-glimpse-of-the-web.html?hpw&_r=1&">New York Times is reporting</a> that the government is planning to open 118 new cybercafés, at which Cuban citizens will be able to go online for  a fee.  Until recently, Internet access in Cuba largely has been limited to access to the country's <a href="https://opennet.net/research/profiles/cuba">domestic intranet</a> or to services designed for foreigners.  While the new cafés will increase availability of Internet access, the price&mdash;$4.50 per hour, in a country where salaries average around $20 per month&mdash;will likely prevent widespread use.

Google is working to build wireless networks in emerging markets in an effort to provide Internet access to a billion people who currently live entirely offline, reports the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323975004578503350402434918.html"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>.  The company has already begun a <a href="http://google-africa.blogspot.se/2013/03/announcing-new-tv-white-spaces-trial-in.html">pilot project</a> in Cape Town, South Africa, transmitting wireless broadband across "white spaces" (unused channels in the broadcast TV spectrum) via three base stations located at Stellenbosch University.  Future projects in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia may use similar technology, or may involve the use of masts, satellites, or <a href="http://techland.time.com/2013/05/28/google-is-reportedly-testing-blimps-that-dole-out-wireless-internet-signals/">"high-altitude platforms"</a>&mdash;blimps&mdash;to transmit signals. 

<strong>Russia</strong>
Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte, <a href="http://blogs.blouinnews.com/blouinbeattechnology/2013/05/24/russian-social-network-blackout-spotlights-internet-censorship/">was temporarily blacklisted</a> for several hours on May 24.  Russian government officials <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/vkontakte-blacklist-ban-russia-mistake/24996067.html">claim the blockage was a mistake</a>, made when an employee accidentally added the entire site, rather than a single offending page, to the country's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22651973">national blacklist</a>.  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/24/russian-social-network-site-vkontakte-banned"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a> that the site's founder, Pavel Durov, has come under government scrutiny in the past for refusing to shut down groups on the site that were used to organize protests during the December 2011 parliamentary elections.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US Department of the Treasury announced last week that it is <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1961.aspx">lifting sanctions</a> against Iran that have prevented the export and provision of software, hardware, and communications services to the country.  The Treasury has issued a <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_gld.pdf">General License</a> (PDF) that permits US companies and citizens to provide:

<ul><li>"fee-based services* incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet, such as instant messaging, chat and email, social networking, sharing of photos and movies, web browsing, and blogging";</li>
<li>"consumer-grade Intemet connectivity services and the provision, sale, or leasing of capacity on telecommunications transmission facilities (such as satellite or terrestrial network connectivity) incident to personal communications";</li>
<li>related software and hardware; and</li>
<li>Internet connectivity services and related satellite/network capacity.</li></ul>

The move, which came just two weeks before Iran's presidential election, has been described as part of the Obama administration's attempt to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-to-help-iranians-beat-government-censors/2013/05/30/94db07b4-c96c-11e2-9245-773c0123c027_story.html">"thwart censorship"</a> in Iran, this time by helping provide access to technology that may help Iranians evade online information controls and avoid hacking.  In the lead-up to the election, both <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/21/iran-election-crackdown-rights-activists">activists</a> and <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/05/21/imweekly-may-21-2013/">Internet users</a> have experienced government interference.  According to the Treasury <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1961.aspx">press release</a>, the new General License "aims to empower the Iranian people as their government intensifies its efforts to stifle their access to information."  

Iranian activist groups have been receptive, saying that the sanctions were ultimately more damaging to individual Internet users than to the Iranian government.  Writing for Slate, Danielle Kehl and Tim Maurer <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/05/confusing_sanctions_are_keeping_important_technologies_from_iranian_activists.html">point out</a> that under the previous ban, many technologies companies opted not to operate at all in Iran, fearing that they might unintentionally run afoul of the law.  Samsung, Nokia, and Apple have all refused to provide access to some or all of their products in Iran or even, in Apple's case, to an <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/06/can-apple-refuse-sell-laptop-iranian-citizen-maybe">Iranian citizen living in the United States</a>.  Iranian human rights activist Ali Akbar Musavi Khoeni <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-us-communications-sanctions-lifted-reaction/25002764.html">called for</a> "clear guidelines and guarantees" for companies operating under the new regulations in order to ensure that the lifting of the sanctions has the best possible effect for Iranian citizens.

				<title>Tiananmen Square Anniversary: China Experiments with Subtle Censorship and Netizens Fight Back with Images</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="docs-internal-guid--142210a-10dd-01d5-e299-f98559479379" dir="ltr">To ensure its country’s Internet remains in good working order, the Chinese government has used June 4 as an unofficial "Internet maintenance" day. In 2009,<a href="http://www.techinasia.com/june-4-china-unofficial-orwellian-internet-maintenance-day/"> more than 300 sites went down</a>. In 2010, a slew of blocked sites (many pornographic)<a href="https://opennet.net/blog/2010/06/china-blocks-foursquare-unblocks-porn"> became accessible</a>. Last year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 64.89 points, leading the popular Chinese microblogging service Sina Weibo to<a href="https://opennet.net/blog/2012/06/china-blocks-references-stock-exchange-tiananmen-anniversary"> ban searches</a> of related terms. Why such erratic behavior? June 4 also marks the day when, in 1989, tanks entered Tiananmen Square to violently quash pro-democracy protests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Days before this year’s 24th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Weibo experimented with a<a href="https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2013/may/sina-testing-subtle-censorship-ahead-tiananmen-anniversary-0"> much subtler form of censorship</a>, but Chinese netizens<a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/130604/9-things-were-censored-today-tiananmen-square"> used creative images</a> to signal their acknowledgement of what Chinese government wishes the country would forget.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Typically, users who search for sensitive terms such as “June 4th incident” receive the message, “According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, search results for [keyword] cannot be displayed.” Beginning on May 31, searches for “Tiananmen incident,” “24th anniversary,” “June 4th,” “64 incident” returned a sanitized list, for example, referencing a 1976 protest that occurred in Tiananmen Square, or a seemingly innocuous message that the search yielded no results, according to <a href="https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2013/may/sina-testing-subtle-censorship-ahead-tiananmen-anniversary-0">analysis</a> from the Chinese Internet transparency organization GreatFire.org.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the evening of June 3, Weibo <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/06/04/tiananmen-effect-big-yellow-duck-a-banned-term/">reverted</a> to displaying its original censorship announcement in response to searches of sensitive terms. Citizen Lab <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2013/06/censoring-a-commemoration-what-june-4-related-search-terms-are-blocked-on-weibo-today/">posted a list</a> of 71 terms blocked on Weibo, many variations on the numbers six, four, and 1989. China Digital Times <a href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2013/06/sensitive-words-24th-anniversary-of-tiananmen/">mentioned additional terms</a> including names of people and places.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The seemingly benign terms <a href="http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/censored-in-china-today-tonight-and-big-yellow-duck/">“today,” “tonight,” “big yellow duck,”</a> and <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/06/04/tiananmen-effect-big-yellow-duck-a-banned-term/">“black shirt”</a> also faced restriction on Weibo. The latter two reference an online meme and calls for Chinese to wear black shirts to observe the anniversary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Weibo’s text filters grow ever more sophisticated, the network seems less able to police images. Chinese netizens <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/06/how-memes-became-best-weapon-against-chinese-internet-censorship/65877/">exploited this fact</a>, posting variations of the iconic “Tank Man” image. One replaced the tanks with yellow rubber ducks (hence the blockage of “big yellow duck”); one showed a cow in front of a line of bulldozers; another showed a praying mantis pushing against a wheel, referencing a popular idiom about the futility of trying to stop the future.</p>
On May 31, the Chinese government also <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/06/03/china-blocks-encrypted-version-of-wikipedia-ahead-of-june-4-tiananmen-anniversary/">cut off access</a> to the encrypted (https) version of Wikipedia, which Chinese Internet users could use to see articles banned on the unencrypted (http) version.]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[This year marks the 24th anniversary of China's Tiananmen Square massacre. In what has become an "Internet maintenance" ritual, the popular microblogging site Weibo blocked terms relating to the event but could not keep up with the memes netizens circulated to memorialize the event.]]></excerpt:encoded>

				<title>Singapore Media License Requirement &quot;Casts a Chill&quot; on Free Expression</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Straits Times <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/over-150-singapore-websites-and-blogs-hold-24-hour-blackout-protest-20">reported</a> that more than 150 websites and blogs in Singapore went black yesterday to protest a new government-imposed licensing requirement that, “casts a chill over the city-state’s robust and free-wheeling online communities,” said Cynthia Wong, Human Rights Watch’s senior Internet researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/07/singapore-licensing-regime-chills-news-climate">in a statement</a>.</p>
Beginning June 1, the Media Development Authority <a href="http://www.mda.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/PressRelease/2013/Pages/28052013.aspx">requires</a> websites that “report regularly on issues relating to Singapore” and attract more than 50,000 unique monthly visitors in Singapore obtain a license and put up an approximately USD$40,000 bond. If the MDA finds “prohibited content,” including that which “undermines racial or religious harmony,” the sites must remove it within 24 hours.
<p dir="ltr">The MDA <a href="http://www.mda.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/PressRelease/2013/Documents/Annex.pdf">identified</a> ten mainstream media outlets that must apply for the license, including Yahoo! Singapore, which calls the requirement <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323844804578527222881965906.html">unsettling</a>. The government said the measure provides consistency with existing media regulations. Siew Kum Hong, a former presidentially appointed member of Parliament, <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130605-427657.html">disagreed</a> with the assertion that the law creates parity with traditional forms of media, mentioning that newspapers found to publish prohibited content do not have to collect unsold copies within 24 hours.</p>
The government also said the measure does not apply to blogs, though it <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/28/net-us-singapore-internet-idUSBRE94R0G220130528?irpc=932">does not rule out</a> including blogs in the future. Netizens <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/03/free-my-internet-movement-rises-in-singapore/">criticized</a> the measure for its <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/06/20136293718623124.html">vague language</a> and the <a href="http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2013/05/major-online-websites-in-singapore-to-protest-against-licensing-requirement/">lack of public consultation</a> involved in its formation. Bloggers launched a <a href="http://www.freemyinternet.com/index.html">#FreeMyInternet</a> campaign and have scheduled a June 8 protest in Hong Lim Park. As of today more than 4,000 people have signed an <a href="http://www.petitions24.com/petition_for_the_immediate_withdrawal_of_the_licensing_regime">online petition</a> demanding the government withdraw the measure.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jordan</strong>
Amendments to media and publication laws lead to a swift shuttering of <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/06/jordan-blocks-over-200-unlicensed-websites/">more than 200 websites</a> in Jordan last week. The Press and Publications Department of Jordan claimed responsibility for generating the list of "unlicensed" sites, including Al Jazeera, the site of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, and <em>Time Out</em> magazine. Criticized as opaque and vague, recent amendments require sites viewable (if not necessarily based) in Jordan to register with the Jordanian government, obtain a license, and actively monitor all content produced on the site in order to actively cooperate with Jordanian law.

<strong>Mexico</strong>
In what lawmakers defended as an <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/03/mexico-local-cyberbullying-law-could-threaten-free-expression/">attempt to curb cyberbullying,</a> Internet users in the Mexican state of Nuevo León may now face up to three years incarceration for posting messages or images to social networks that cause "harm, dishonor, discredit to a person, or exposes him or her to contempt." Defamation is a felon in Nuevo León and the amendment marks an expansion to the stringent laws to apply online. Website operators are also required by law to reveal to authorities the identity of anyone committing an act of defamation. Critics call the legislation opaque and vague, offering undue power to authorities who may wish to quell criticism against public officials.

<strong>Turkey</strong>
As protests swell in Turkey, Internet users are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jun/04/turkish-protestors-encryption-software-evade-censors">using virtual private networks (VPNs)</a> in large numbers to skirt suspected government censorship. Last weekend, more than 120,000 mobile users in Turkey downloaded the free VPM Hotspot Shield, according to the manufacturer. The figure marked a ten thousandfold increase in typical daily downloads for the software on Saturday. Sources inside Turkey reported access to social networking sites in the country were throttled over the last weekend while Turkcell, the largest mobile carrier in the country, denied claims it was blocking the sites. Protests continue in Turkey at time of writing, defying an appeal from the prime minister end the unrest.

Ahead of last week’s anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the Chinese government engaged in what has now become an expected annual crackdown on Internet freedom. This year, however, the government adopted more <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/06/04/tiananmen-square-anniversary-china-experiments-with-subtle-censorship-and-netizens-fight-back-with-images/">advanced and subtle means of censorship</a>. Rather than blocking all search results for sensitive terms, websites such as Weibo are instead displaying <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/05/31/on-eve-of-tiananmen-anniversary-a-major-censorship-shift/">carefully curated results</a> that have little to do with the 1989 protests.

Although Chinese censorship is ever-more sophisticated, Internet users in China are finding creative ways to express themselves and commemorate the tragedy. Memes - spontaneous, humorous, grass-roots-style online satirical works - are a significant feature of the Chinese Internet, ranging from 2009’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Mud_Horse">Grass Mud Horse</a> to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/05/chen-guangcheng-has-a-posse-and-ai-weiwei-is-everywhere-memes-as-dissent-in-china/">memes involving sunflower seeds and self-portraits of people wearing sunglasses</a>, both inspired by arrested Chinese dissidents. These memes take the form of photos, videos, animations, and texts that defy and ridicule Chinese authorities.

This year, Chinese Internet users created multiple variations of an iconic photograph from the 1989 protests, incorporating images ranging from yellow ducks to Legos. These images began to circulate through social media in China days before the June 4<sup>th</sup> anniversary as a way to bypass censorship, and gained momentum largely for their humor and brevity.

The famous photograph – known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man">“Tank Man”</a> – of the 1989 protest has long been banned in Chinese cyberspace. The photo, featuring a man blocking a series of tanks during the Tiananmen Square protest on June 4, 1989, directly points to the dictatorship of Chinese government and has startled people worldwide.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-147" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/tank-man1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" />

Days before this year’s Tiananmen Square Anniversary, someone wittily replaced the four tanks in the original photograph with giant yellow ducks. The meme is based on a 54-foot-tall duck sculpture, created by a Dutch artist, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/15/hong-kong-rubber-duck-deflates">that currently floats in Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor.</a>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-146 aligncenter" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/yellow-duck-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />

The “tank man” picture is also photoshopped into a Lego man facing down three green Lego tanks. By embedding these images in posts instead of using banned keywords, Internet users can often escape automatic deletion.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-148" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/lego-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" />

Another picture showing a cow in front of a line of bulldozers is also getting past Weibo’s censors. While Weibo has <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/06/how-memes-became-best-weapon-against-chinese-internet-censorship/65877/">blocked the words “big yellow duck”</a> in response to the memes, the word “cow” appears to be uncensored.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-150" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/cpw1-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" />

While censors continue to add new words to the <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2013/06/sensitive-words-24th-anniversary-of-tiananmen/">blocklist</a>, Internet users continue to create new images, making it impossible for the government to shut down conversation about the Tiananmen Square protests entirely.]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[A new torrent of words including "today" and "June 4" referencing the Tiananmen Square Anniversary have been blocked from Chinese social media as the country engages in its annual crackdown on Internet, also known as "Internet Maintenance Day." And though the Chinese government is running a sophisticated and tight censorship ship, they're having a bit harder time blocking memes.

In May 2013, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/number-active-users-facebook-over-230449748.html" target="_blank">Facebook announced</a> that it had 1.1 billion users, 665 million of which were active on the site each day. The three major global social networks (Facebook, Google+, and Twitter) have all experienced huge growth in the last few years. According to the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/google-moves-up-to-second-place-in-social-networks-7000010372/" target="_blank">GlobalWebIndex</a>, of the global Internet population approximately 51% use Facebook on a monthly basis, 25% use Google+, and 21% use Twitter. Despite the rapid growth of these social networks, many users have become dissatisfied with their business models, political practices, constantly changing posting policies, and undemocratic forms of governance. Aside from the concerns over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)" target="_blank">PRISM</a>, Facebook has recently drawn attention for its <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57578305-71/facebook-actually-sorry-for-banning-breastfeeding-pic/" target="_blank">blocking pictures of breastfeeding mothers</a> or the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/facebook-admits-it-failed-hate-speech-following-fbrape-twitter-campaign-advertiser-boycott-1282815" target="_blank">company’s handling of rape joke memes</a> spreading through their network. Activists and political dissidents in particular have found these social media sites stifling and sometimes dangerous, but often find themselves with few alternatives to spread their messages online.

As a result, several interesting social media alternatives have recently been created to address these concerns and protect both privacy and dissent online. While many social network projects have launched over the past few years, few alternatives remain in active development. Below is a curated list of the best current alternatives for people with moderate computers skills concerned with privacy, control of their information, and networking outside the control of governments or corporations.

<a href="http://diasporaproject.org/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-212" style="color: #333333;border: 0px;margin: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/Diaspora_dandy_logo-300x225.png" alt="" width="158" height="119" /><strong>Diaspora:</strong></a> This nonprofit, user-owned, social network consists of a group of independently owned "pods" that interoperate to form the network. Since its launch in 2010 by four students at New York University's <a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>, Diaspora has been one of the most popular alternative social media sites. As of June 2013,<a href="https://diasp.eu/stats.html" target="_blank"> Diaspora reports</a> it has 405,551 registered accounts (which includes users on the main pod and connected people from other pods) and 2,270,599 estimated users on the most popular pod (estimated because that information is not public) participating in this distributed social network. Diaspora allows for pseudonyms, ensures users own their content, and because the network is distributed by other users who install the freeware and setup web servers, the network cannot easily be disrupted or its users surveilled.

<a href="https://join.app.net/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-219" style="border: 0px;margin: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/app_net_logo-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="119" /><strong>App.net:</strong></a> In July 2012, this platform evolved beyond being a place for developers to showcase new apps and became a full-fledged social network. The design of App.net is fairly similar to Twitter, but with one big difference. Instead of selling user data to advertisers, the site requires users and developers to pay subscription fees for premium accounts ($5 monthly, $36 yearly, or $100 a year for developers). There are no ads on App.net, but more importantly for social activists and people concerned with controlling their data, App.net will only share information with third party vendors the service needs to work (like payment processors for accounts) and law enforcement (if proper legal channels are observed). When a user deletes something from App.net, the company makes sure it’s gone from their servers within two weeks. It’s not a completely private social network, but it’s close.

<a href="https://tent.io/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-223" style="background-color: #eeeeee;border: 0px;margin: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/logo-300x193.png" alt="" width="144" height="93" /><strong>Tent.io:</strong></a> This Twitter-like (but not Twitter-clone) alternative offers many of the same advantages App.net boasts, but rests on an entirely different method for distributing information. Tent is an open Internet protocol, like email or TCP/IP, that can be used to run a Tent server (via <a href="https://tent.is/" target="_blank">Tent.is</a>) or connect several social networks together. Tent.is offers users the ability to run their own server, lets them share anything, and is designed to help users migrate from other social medias. Tent can also be run as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor" target="_blank">Tor hidden service</a>, which can allow activists to communicate without being traced, and because Tent is decentralized, it cannot be blocked the same way Twitter has been in several countries. Tent also touts itself as a better alternative even to email since users can change their address and the followers come with them. Tent also argues it fosters innovation since applications can be developed for Tent without needing to ask for permission from the protocol's owners. The Tent protocol can be used with Tent.is or be used independently to grow other networks. Tent is a bit more technical than the other alternatives featured here, but its flexibility and expandability mean it’s likely to continue developing.

<a href="http://glassboard.com/"><img class="alignright  wp-image-225" style="border: 0px;margin: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/534241_407590939280742_1261786049_n.jpg" alt="" width="129" height="129" /><strong>GlassBoard:</strong></a> Featuring a very simple and comprehensive privacy policy, GlassBoard is probably the easiest to use of the alternative social networks featured here. GlassBoard’s innovation in social networking is to make money by charging a small user fee rather than sell information to advertisers. Perhaps because they know many people have indicated they would not pay for access to a social network, even if it meant more control over their information, GlassBoard does offer a free account with some limitations, and premium accounts with more storage or access to APIs. GlassBoard also offers iPhone and Android apps, all user data is encrypted on GlassBoard's servers, and they won't sell your personal information for targeting ads. GlassBoard does not have privacy settings. Instead, everything a user does on the service is private and can only be seen by people they approve. While GlassBoard primarily focuses on providing businesses with a private communications network, anyone willing to have some storage limitations or pay a bit for a premium account can enjoy a very simple, secure, and mobile social network.

<a href="http://identi.ca/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-227" style="margin: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/760px-Identi.ca_logo_svg.svg_-300x225.png" alt="" width="151" height="114" /><strong>Identi.ca:</strong></a> Identi.ca is another micro-blogging service similar to Twitter, but offers many features Twitter does not such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP" target="_blank">XMPP</a> support and the ability to freely export personal and “friend” data. Identi.ca enjoyed early success when more than 8,000 people registered for the service within the first 24 hours of its public launch in July 2008. For those concerned with controlling their information, Identi.ca will publish all posts under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license</a> by default, but paying customers have to option to choose a different license. In June 2013, Identi.ca began migrating to the <a href="http://pump.io/" target="_blank">pump.io</a> software platform in order to offer more features, and its development is likely to continue. Setting up the free and open source software on a server requires a bit more technical skill than most of the other alternatives presented here, and joining might be delayed until the migration to pump.io finishes, but this open source social network is worth watching.

For those not ready to completely abandon Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ there are still a few options for managing how user data is used. Two good browswer add-ons for determining exactly where your data is going are <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/collusion/" target="_blank">Collusion</a> for Mozilla Firefox and <a href="http://www.privacyscore.com/addon" target="_blank">PrivacyScore</a> for Google Chrome.  To keep Facebook, Google, and Twitter from tracking you (and to speed up your browser), the <a href="https://disconnect.me/" target="_blank">Disconnect</a> extension works well with Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Finally, to opt out of other advertising that tracks users, the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative's</a> website will show who is tracking a user's browser and how to disable it.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Government “Bird Dogs” on the Loose in Saudi Arabia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In clashes between Saudi citizens and the state over ideology and technology, Twitter has become a highly contested space. Internet monitoring and censorship in the Kingdom is not new though. According to a 2009 report from <a href="https://opennet.net/studies/saudiarabia2007">the Open Net Initiative</a>, “Saudi Arabia filters sites related to opposition political groups, human rights issues, and religious content deemed offensive to Muslims.” <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Saudi%20Arabia%202012.pdf">Freedom House</a> published a report in 2012 putting Internet penetration in Saudi’s population of 29 million at 49%. It also stated that 51% of Saudis are active Twitter users, one of the highest usage rates in the world. In recent months, religious and political leaders as well as everyday Twitter users have taken to the ethereal skies of Twitter to express their views on how and by whom the social networking site should be used.

It is easy to adopt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithology">ornithological</a> metaphors when talking about Twitter, and we can extend talk of birds in a particular way within the Arab Gulf context, where <a href="http://www.iaf.org/HistoryFalconry.php">falconry </a> is a big deal. The sport has ancient roots and great cultural significance. Falcons are magnificent birds of prey, revered and respected in the region for their adaptability, speed, and hunting prowess. The birds, also called raptors, scan the desert sands for prey and swoop in for the kill with pinpoint accuracy. In the Arab Gulf, the falcon is elegance, beauty, and skill with wings.

[caption id="attachment_182" align="aligncenter" width="475"]<a href="http://gulfnews.com/a-rich-heritage-of-sport-1.28209"><img class="size-full wp-image-182" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/falcon.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="328" /></a> "Sporting with the best: Hamad AlGhanem, Director, Breeder and Registrar General of the Arabian Saluki Centre, poses with a falcon and two of his favourite salukis. Falconry and saluki races are a part of Arab culture."- Gulf News[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">The same regal attributes may or may not apply, however, to the little blue birds that soar in the Twittersphere. Saudi authorities, acting like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_dog">government bird dogs</a>, have been on the hunt for Twitter users lately.</p>
<a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/05/history-of-twitter/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-183" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/tweet-pic-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">In early May, Saudi religious police issued warnings that the social networking site was <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/05/16/saudi-arabia-twitter-hell/">"a path to hell."</a>  Sheikh Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh said Muslims who use Twitter have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22543252">"lost this world and [their] afterlife."</a> Despite this warning, Saudis—including religious leaders—continue to use the platform. Just weeks after al-Sheikh’s pronouncement, Abdullah Mohammed al-Dawood, an ultraconservative cleric with an active Twitter following, used Twitter to post his views on women going to work in Saudi Arabia. His tweet encouraged men to “harass” women working in public places, so they would return to their homes. Public outrage in response to al-Dawood’s comment was <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/05/30/Saudi-cleric-encourages-harassing-working-women.html">swift and decidedly critical</a>. Graphic suggestions about what punishment he deserved, <a href="https://twitter.com/SusieOfArabia/status/339760529658757122">including castration,</a> circulated in local social media—including Twitter, where the hashtag “#arm_female_cashiers” was used in reaction to al-Dawood’s call to “#harass_female_cashiers”—<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22705573">and spread globally</a> via major news sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Despite threats to body and soul, Saudi citizens, journalists and activists continue to retweet rather than retreat. In fact, according to a recent poll about people’s attitudes toward information sharing on the Internet, <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/news/453858">Saudis are among the most willing to share "everything."</a> This is not exactly divine revelation to progressive Saudi thinkers and leaders such as Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who addressed Saudi Telecommunications directly from his Twitter account: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/07/world/meast/saudi-arabia-social-media">trying to block social media platforms is a "losing war."</a></p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing the link to your blog post, and congratulations on the first of what will be many more postings.  Liked the extended ornithological metaphor.   There is a certain irony, however, in our preoccupation with the crude efforts of the Saudi conservative establishment to limit freedoms of expression in light of the revelations about the massive scale of the NSA's surveillance of internet communications of American citizens.  If Saudi clerics are behaving like "bird dogs", a pack of wolves seems like the right metaphor to describe how the US government is behaving!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Such a great piece, Leigh. Great job. 

Puts into relevant, social perspective an issue that many women in those environments battle with: the very platform that's meant to be your vehicle of freedom, self-expression and liberation, being used to counteract those intentions and bully them further into submission. When tradition is challenged it's always a matter of time to anticipate the push back...and the only thing you're left with is how will I barrel through this obstacle.
 
But the wonderful revelation it also brings to past is the resiliency that exists in all underrepresented and disregarded groups of people. And the ability to always seek out and utilize all resources to not only challenge what's been a formidable, crippling force...but to also engage others in discourse that may seem irrelevant to their own social goings-on, but really does have an effect on all women and our progression as a unit--and to society. And these women offer so much by way of strength by any means necessary!

Wouldn't it be cool if there was a "ReTweet" don't "Retreat" movement?! With t-shirts made of the little blue Twitter bird with the words Retreat written on it, sitting in one of those anti-, red circles with the slash going through it....]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Twitter’s CEO Dick Costolo has called the popular microblogging service “<a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/11/27/dick-costolo-says-twitter-is-a-reinvention-of-the-town-square-but-with-tv/">the pulse of the planet</a>.” With a little less than <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/05/the-world-according-to-twitter-in-maps/">eight percent</a> of the world’s population on Twitter, that pulse has room to grow. Nevertheless, recent big data research into the geography of the Twittersphere sheds light on where users tweet, with whom they tweet, and what information they share. The findings illustrate that Twitter helps people transcend geographic boundaries that restricted communication in a pre-digital age.

A research team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign examined location data from the Twitter Decahose, which includes 10 percent of tweets sent on a given day. The team examined more than 1.5 billion tweets sent from more than 71 million unique users over 39 days and documented its findings in a <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4366/3654">paper</a> published online.

<strong>Extracting Location from Tweets</strong>
Twitter displays the long-tail phenomenon of user participation: 85 percent of tweets come from the top 15 percent of users, and one-fifth of tweets come from just one percent of users. Only 3 percent of tweets are georeferenced, meaning their metadata includes location information. Echoing the long-tail, two-thirds of georeferenced tweets come from one percent of users, representing a small subset of Twitter users.

Researchers dramatically expanded the number of located tweets through geocoding. They analyzed information from user-generated Location and Profile fields and inferred location for more than one-third of tweets from the Decahose. These fields remain fairly static as a user tweets, so future researchers may be better off geocoding users rather than tweets. This could simplify location-based Twitter research by reducing the number of data points to analyze, saving time and computing power.

Though Twitter users communicate in a variety of languages (the most multilingual areas being Hungary, Serbia, Lebanon, Israel, and the West Bank), they tend to provide their location data in English.

<strong>Where Do People Tweet From?</strong>
Where electricity exists. The map below overlays georeferenced tweets with NASA <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=55167">Earth’s City Lights</a> images. Red dots represent georeferenced tweets, blue dots represent access to electricity, and white dots represent an equal balance of tweets and electricity.

The map reminds us that accessibility to digital tools still relies on accessibility to tangible infrastructure, though the proclivity of red illustrates that people tweet even when electricity is scarce. (The box around Japan reflects some tweets from boats but is also the relic of old third-party Twitter clients that “handled the country’s polygonal shape a bit oddly,” Leetaru explained in an email).

Most georeferenced Twitter users joined in 2010 (shown in green on the map below), with concentrations of European, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian users joining in 2011 (shown in blue on the map below).

<strong>Who Do People Communicate With on Twitter?</strong>

People on Twitter retweet and reference close-by and far-away users at almost equal rates. A map of geocoded retweets reveals patterns among continental communication. The researchers <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4366/3654#p6">write</a>:
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Latin America is more closely connected to Europe than to the United States, while Asia connects more closely to the U.S. and the Middle East connects to both the U.S. and Europe. The east coast of the United States is a clear nexus point for the country, through Europe appears to be more dominant than the United States in producing content retweeted by the rest of the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
[caption id="attachment_268" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://www.sgi.com/go/twitter/images/hires/figure14.png"><img class=" wp-image-268 " src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/figure_14.jpg" alt="A map showing the location connections between retweets." width="600" height="300" /></a> This map shows the location connections between users who retweet other users. Image via First Monday/Leetaru, et al. Click image for high-resolution version.[/caption]

Research from 2012 <a href="http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/publications/twitter_geo/Geography_of_Twitter_Networks.PDF">showed</a> Twitter users tended to follow people geographically close to them and those located in areas easily accessible by flight. That paper examined pairs of followers, but the University of Illinois team maintains that retweets and references to other users are better indicators than followers of how much a user pays attention to another user’s tweets.

<strong>What Do People Share on Twitter?</strong>
Mostly social media. More than half of all links in tweets go to six domains: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, ask.fm, and Tumblr. Only 7.8 percent of all links people share on Twitter reference English mainstream news. The most popular sources for English-language news on Twitter include the BBC, Huffington Post, New York Times, and Guardian.

People link to articles about close-by and far-away news at almost equal rates. The map below compares regional references on Twitter and in Google News’ RSS feed. Blue dots represent more georeferenced Twitter coverage, red dots represent more mainstream media coverage, and white dots represent equal coverage.

[caption id="attachment_269" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://www.sgi.com/go/twitter/images/hires/figure17.png"><img class=" wp-image-269 " src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/figure_17.jpg" alt="This map compares Twitter and mainstream media coverage of areas around the world." width="600" height="299" /></a> The blue dots represent Twitter coverage of an area and the red dots represent mainstream media coverage of an area. Image via First Monday/Leetaru, et al. Click image for high-resolution version.[/caption]

Twitter appears to cover more information on Latin America and Eastern Europe, while mainstream media covers Africa, South Asia, and East Asia more thoroughly.

The most influential users, based on <a href="http://klout.com/home">Klout</a> score, concentrate in Malaysia, Indonesia, France, Spain, the U.K., the U.S. and Venezuela. The least influential, meaning those whose content is least likely to spread around the Web, reside in Eastern Europe, the Middle East (especially Turkey), India, and Southeast Asia.

The National Security Agency <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/us/nsa-verizon-calls.html?ref=surveillanceofcitizensbygovernment&amp;_r=0">has confirmed</a> that it has been operating a global electronic surveillance program, collecting information from Google, Facebook, and other tech companies under a program called PRISM, after Booz Allen employee and NSA contractor <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance">Edward Snowden</a> leaked inside documents. The news has triggered a <a href="https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=9260">widespread outcry</a> from human rights advocates and organizations. 

<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>
In March, Saudi Arabian officials declared that the country would <a href="http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201306062104-0022812">block access</a> to three popular voice and messaging services&mdash;Viber, Skype, and WhatsApp&mdash;if the companies did not give the government access to local monitoring services.  The government has followed through on its threat, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22806848">blocking Viber</a> on June 6.  On June 11, the block was <a href="http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/technology/messenger-app-viber-restored-in-saudi-says-report_77844.html">rescinded</a>, though whether Viber has complied with government demands for monitoring access is unclear.

<strong>Iran</strong>
Iranian Gmail users were <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/iran-hack-election/">reporting evidence of phishing attacks</a>, just days before last week's presidential elections. The attacks, which appear to be originating from within the country, have been occurring for three weeks; in a blog post, Google Vice President of Security Engineering Eric Grosse said the attacks were likely <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.hk/2013/06/iranian-phishing-on-rise-as-elections.html">politically motivated</a>.  Google security staff said the phishing attacks appeared to be conducted by the same group that conducted attacks in Iran in 2011 <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20098894-245/fraudulent-google-certificate-points-to-internet-attack/">using a fraudulent Google certificate</a>.]]></content:encoded>

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.general/12588/" target="_blank">announced plans</a> to build a new electronic currency—totally peer-to-peer and requiring no third party intermediaries—called Bitcoins. In order to get new Bitcoins, users would install programs on their computers called "Bitcoin miners" that would solve complex mathematical puzzles. By making the puzzles difficult and only solvable after some heavy computing, coins would be slowly introduced into the system over time and the coins randomly distributed to users. These mining programs would search for a sequence of data that produces a particular pattern which, when found, gives the miner a small amount of Bitcoins. Simply put, users could make Bitcoins by using their computers' processing power to solve these puzzles and generate new coins. As of 2009, the number of new Bitcoins has been designed to halve every 4 years until 2140, after which the number of Bitcoins will have reached a <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/" target="_blank">maximum of 21 million coins</a>, and no more Bitcoins will be added into circulation.

This system worked well for the first few years, but since Bitcoin mining became widely practiced in 2009, the easy puzzles have been solved, and more processing power has been needed to solve the increasingly harder puzzles. Though there are other ways to obtain Bitcoins (like buying them with other currencies, or trading them for products and services, or through processing fees), mining the coins is still the only way to introduce more coins into the system. As Bitcoin mining requires increasing computing power for diminishing returns, the low-powered computers found in homes and offices are no longer up to the task of virtual mining.

In April 2013, Mark Gimein at Bloomberg published <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-12/virtual-bitcoin-mining-is-a-real-world-environmental-disaster.html" target="_blank">an article</a> calling Bitcoin mining an “environmental disaster” that consumes 982 megawatt hours a day, or enough power to run <a href="http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3" target="_blank">31,000 US homes</a>. Additionally, the value of Bitcoins is subject to <a href="http://bitcoinprices.com/" target="_blank">massive fluctuations</a> in the currency trading markets, threats by various governments to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/05/29/after-liberty-reserve-shut-down-is-bitcoin-next/" target="_blank">shut down</a> the experiment, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/05/lets-cut-through-the-bitcoin-hype/" target="_blank">hacker attacks</a> on the Bitcoin system. Just three days before the Gimein published his article, Bitcoin values <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-loses-77-of-value-from-high-2013-4" target="_blank">plummeted by 77%</a> after hackers and new users put pressure on the system. A month later, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/17/bitcoin-operator-accounts-seized_n_3293937.html" target="_blank">US authorities seized</a> the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, and earlier this week the IRS declared <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/the-tax-man-cometh-for-your-bitcoins-20130618" target="_blank">Bitcoins a taxable income</a>. While Bitcoin has made a few people wealthy, Bitcoin miners are quite literally converting thousands of megawatt hours into virtual currency, the future of which is extremely uncertain. Just like mining for gold in the real-world, mining for virtual coins presents serious political, economic, and environmental issues.

[caption id="attachment_306" align="alignleft" width="135"]<img class=" wp-image-306         " style="margin: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/361px-Gluehlampe_01_KMJ-180x300.png" alt="" width="135" height="226" /> courtesy of Jeff Kubina/Flickr[/caption]

While Bitcoins may be the one of the most obvious challenges to the virtual-material divide, it may not be the most significant. In September 2012, the New York Times estimated that digital data centers worldwide use about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">30 billion watts of electricity</a> (or about the same as the output of 30 nuclear power plants), with the US responsible for about one-third of that usage. According to Google, a single search uses about 0.0003 kWh (1080 joules) of energy, which is roughly the same as turning on a <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/09/09/6-things-youd-never-guess-about-googles-energy-use/" target="_blank">60W light bulb for 17 seconds</a>. Another estimate found that a 140 character <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1620676/how-much-energy-does-tweet-consume" target="_blank">Tweet consumes about 90 joules</a>, which is roughly enough energy to power that same light bulb for 1.4 seconds.

But what about when no one is actively using these services? A <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEgQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMcKinsey_%2526_Company&amp;ei=LPXBUeD2Ms3h4AP25QE&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0yQhk0V98txqgJS2vWTj1M9xfYQ&amp;sig2=1LALkjQC1G2n4tvHyJe-cQ" target="_blank">McKinsey &amp; Company</a> report estimated that an average data center only uses 6 to 12% of its electricity for computation, while nearly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">90% of energy use goes into keeping servers idling</a> in case of a surge in activity that could crash operations. Companies keep their facilities running around the clock at maximum capacity, regardless of demand, because they fear what might happen if their services are interrupted.

<a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/scenes-from-how-green-is-the-internet/"><img class="alignright  wp-image-316" style="border: 0px;margin: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/google-schmidt-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="169" /></a>Earlier this month, Google hosted a summit at the Googleplex to consider “<a href="https://www.google.com/events/howgreenistheinternet2013/" target="_blank">How green is the Internet?</a>” In his keynote address, energy researcher Jon Koomey estimated that the Internet is probably responsible for about <a href="http://www.techthefuture.com/technology/how-much-electricity-does-the-internet-use/" target="_blank">10% of the world’s total electricity consumption</a>. Koomey, who has been studying the material impact of the Internet since 2000, noted that the numbers are difficult to track, but suggested that companies that have made their names collecting data could do a better job tracking electrical use. Eric Masanet from Northwestern University found this lack of data troubling enough that he launched a publicly available model for assessing the energy effects of cloud computing called <a href="http://cleermodel.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">CLEER</a>.

Koomey also noted that moving to digital communications and networks has reduced overall electricity use. For example, Koomey argues, businesses and organizations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwh9qk_dTqo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=45s" target="_blank">reduce their use of electricity</a> by allowing companies like Google to host their email servers rather than run their own. The subtext of many of the “How green is the Internet?” keynotes was fairly obvious; if you care about the environment, move your data and processing to the cloud. Google made this connection clear when the company posted on its blog about the summit and cited a study (sponsored by Google) from the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory" target="_blank"> Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> that found that migrating all US office workers to the cloud <a href="http://www.businesscloudnews.com/2013/06/12/moving-services-to-the-cloud-may-reduce-energy-use-up-to-87/" target="_blank">could save up to 87% of IT energy use</a> (or enough to power the city of Los Angeles for a year).

From an environmental perspective, Google has done its best to make migrating to the cloud attractive. Google is one of the largest investors in renewable energy, has <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEEQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenwisebusiness.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fgoogle-banks-on-airborne-wind-turbine-device-to-help-address-future-world-energy-needs-3996.aspx&amp;ei=i_vBUcC4FrTJ4APFs4GADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGX3dE_-6oovCbDJrJ7kZ8EoS7Kfw&amp;sig2=G6MdwiGK1rOLnLV4hO6hxQ&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.dmg" target="_blank">commissioned several wind farms</a>, and uses <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFcQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacenterknowledge.com%2Farchives%2F2012%2F10%2F17%2Fhow-google-cools-its-armada-of-servers%2F&amp;ei=wfvBUanTLIn64AP044G4Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa-RDq10Pg4yqecbG62kz8uUQaAg&amp;sig2=xhLbOzo4JSrMKY5_i2kH_w&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.dmg" target="_blank">more efficient cooling towers</a> for its servers than most Internet companies (though currently only <a href="https://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/" target="_blank">33% of its energy use is renewable</a>).

Recently, several cloud computing companies like <a href="https://cloudhashing.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Hashing</a> have begun offering services that allow users to use outsource their Bitcoin mining processes to their cloud servers. Bitcoin mining isn't the only service being migrated to the cloud. Last year, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/06/adobe-goes-all-in-with-subscription-based-creative-cloud-will-stop-selling-regular-cs-licenses-shrink-wrapped-boxes/" target="_blank">Adobe announced</a> its decision to begin offering its Creative Suite of products, like the popular Photoshop and Illustrator, on its cloud service exclusively. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57589987-92/adobe-ceo-were-off-to-a-good-start-with-subscriptions-q-a/" target="_blank">Adobe reported this week</a> that 700,000 users have begun using their “Creative Cloud” service and hopes to have 4 million users by 2015. Adobe's decision to offer its services via the cloud was primarily motivated by its need to combat piracy of its software and also to roll out updates quicker, not necessarily because the company wanted to decrease end user energy consumption. Other data gathering companies have a stronger interest in collecting, storing, and mining user data. Last week, Google caused some <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm" target="_blank">controversy and user confusion</a> after completing an update to its mobile Gmail app, making archive (rather than delete) the default setting for mobile users. Google didn't remove the delete option&mdash;it's still available through menu actions&mdash;but the company is clearly <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9239918/New_Gmail_app_adds_a_touch_of_color_and_frustration" target="_blank">nudging users</a> away from deleting emails. Much like mining Bitcoins, mining user data or letting users search archived messages requires sifting through massive amounts of data looking for particular patterns or text.

While Adobe’s new cloud services might use less energy than what individual computers running the software requires, and companies like Apple and Google are moving to renewable energies, the lack of energy usage transparency prevents users from knowing the actual costs of cloud computing. Many people go out of their way to turn off the lights when they leave a room or recycle soda cans, but become angry when a site loads slowly or they can’t instantly find an email archived four years ago in Gmail. The data centers that store and process old emails and tweets already use more than <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/3/3/034008/" target="_blank">2% of the US electricity supply</a> (more than the notoriously energy demanding paper industry). When one considers how much energy is involved in Internet use, “the cloud" rapidly comes down to Earth.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Syria’s tech-savvy and socially engaged citizens are resisting the state in creative ways. Conflict is never black and white, and in today’s ever-more-connected world, attempts to address conflict are often quite colorful. This was evident earlier this month when <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/06/11/culture-memes-as-creative-resistance-on-tiananmen-square-anniversary/">Chinese bloggers morphed a classic photo</a> of citizen resistance from Tiananmen Square, changing a line of government tanks into a parade of big yellow ducks. The image was powerful and provocative; thus <a href="http://anxiaostudio.com/2011/12/28/social-media-street-art-censorship-chinas-political-memes-and-the-cute-cat-theory/">the role of the meme in Chinese social media</a>.<span style="text-align: center"> </span>

Syrian citizens’ imaginations are also playing out colorfully on the Internet. Taking a closer look at the nuances of Syria’s resistance movement can help us complicate the oversimplified and often exoticized picture of people and events in the Middle East that is presented in popular media. <a href="http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/8125/syrian-hands-raised_user-generated-creativity-betw">In a recent article for Jadaliyya</a>, Berkman fellow and researcher <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/ddellaratta">Donatella Della Ratta</a> suggests, “As much as images of violence, civil war, and sectarian strife become prominent in the media narrative of the Syrian uprising, little gems of innovative cultural production, artistic resistance, and creative disobedience continue to sprout across the virtual alleys of the Internet.”

So what does a civil society movement on the Internet look like in a time of civil war?  In the case of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/I-am-with-Syria/158886784177416?fref=ts">"I am with Syria"</a> campaign, it looks much like a volley of artistic images with subtle political messages. The back and forth that started on the streets continues to play out on Facebook, <a href="https://twitter.com/CreativeSyrian">Twitter</a>, and blogs.

<img class="size-full wp-image-331 alignleft" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/Iam-free-rainbow-.png" alt="" width="127" height="127" />

Eye-catching posters began to show up in Syria around the time the uprising began in March 2011. The first round of images was published by the al-Bashar regime and featured the phrase, “I am with the law.” Iterations included, “whether progressive or conservative, I am with the law,” “whether boy or girl, …” and “whether young or old, ....” Citizens were insulted by the campaign’s assumption that the law was the exclusive domain of the state and that anyone opposed to the regime was outside the law. They responded initially by vandalizing the posters, but soon developed a less aggressive form of resistance. They designed their own posters with their own slogans, riffing on both “I am with the law” and on an updated version of the government campaign that used “I am with Syria, my demands are your demands” as the primary text.  These user-generated designs—ranging from “I am with Syria, my demands are freedom,” to increasingly humorous and satirical statements—appealed to Syrians’ sense of humor, beauty, and creativity rather than instigating division and bloodshed.

Citizen-generated versions of the posters showed up on the streets and were widely disseminated online, particularly on Facebook. In May 2011, the “I am with Syria” Facebook page was launched; it continues to post images and host comments. One of the resistance posters states, “I am with Syria, I lost my shoes,” which is a cultural reference suggesting that people have thrown their shoes at al-Bashar as an expression of their disrespect. When <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWt3-kPBQ4A">a man threw his shoes at George Bush in 2008,</a> it made global headlines. Throwing your shoe at someone is a serious insult in the Arab world. “I lost my shoes” is just one of the <a href="http://muftah.org/irony-satire-and-humor-in-the-battle-for-syria/">culturally rich jokes, parodies, and satirical slogans</a> that went viral as part of the “I am with Syria” Internet campaign..

Image courtesy of Ammar Alani via Donatella Della Ratta.[/caption]

“I am with Syria” is a playing out across the Internet like a conversation in the language of memes that gets a clear message of political resistance across, without inciting further violence in a country already ravaged by civil war. The central image of the campaign has always been an upward reaching human arm that represents an alif- the first of 28 characters in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV5YZ3noYkk">the Arabic alphabet</a>. Atop the alif is a hamza, (an Arabic marker equivalent to a vowel sound in English). A human hand stands in for the hamza. The hand is open in both government and citizen- inspired posters. That the counter campaign kept the open hand speaks to its central spirit and purpose. The hand could have been a fist- a classic symbol of resistance- fight the power so to speak- but this hand is extended and open, <a href="http://www.iamsyria.org/">waiting for another hand to grab on and link up.</a>  One of the strategies of war is to divide and fracture communities; in the case of Syria, the Internet is helping people in battle-weary communities stay connected.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Tunisia</strong>
The <a href="http://www.ati.tn/ar/home.php" target="_blank">Tunisian Internet Agency</a> building, the center of the former Tunisian regime's Internet censorship facuilities and once a home of the former dictator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali" target="_blank">Ben Ali</a>, is being changed into a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/eff-calls-tunisian-court-uphold-right-free-expression" target="_blank">hackerspace</a> and <a href="https://openwireless.org/routers" target="_blank">open wifi</a> hotspot for nearby citizens.  Plans are in the works to extend the range of the building's routers to allow Internet sharing with more of the population.

<strong>Pakistan</strong>
A <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2013/06/o-pakistan/" target="_blank">recent report</a> from the <a href="http://citizenlab.org/" target="_blank">Citizen Lab</a> found that Pakistan is using <a href="http://netsweeper.com/" target="_blank">Netsweeper</a>, a filtering technology managed by a Canadian company, to block websites or tamper with DNS. The Pakistani government is planning to block more URLs and SMS text messages in the country. However, <a href="http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/465454/pakistan_using_netsweeper_block_internet_content_say_researchers/" target="_blank">five international companies</a> who sell surveillance and filtering software have committed not to help Pakistan, after protests from civil rights groups.

<strong>Mexico</strong>
Human rights activists have filed a <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/88139762/Finfisher.pdf" target="_blank">request</a> to investigate the use of the <a href="http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/index.php" target="_blank">FinFisher</a> surveillance software by the Mexican government, which they suspect has been used to spy on journalists and activists in the country. A <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2013/04/for-their-eyes-only-2/" target="_blank">Citizen Lab report</a> detailing FinFisher’s use in 36 countries was the spark that prompted the investigation. Drug-related violence in the country <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/21/mexico-advocates-demand-investigation-of-finfisher-spyware/" target="_blank">may have allowed</a> the government to launch several surveillance programs without significant resistance from civil society.

<strong>United States</strong>
Facebook announced it has fixed a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/important-message-from-facebooks-white-hat-program/10151437074840766" target="_blank">bug on Friday</a> which has potentially leaked 600 million users’ email addresses and phone numbers. The bug allowed users downloading an archive of their user account to also download other users’ information.

Modern editions of Mary Shelly's <em>Frankenstein</em> often drop Shelly's 1818 full title for the celebrated novel, which reads, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein" target="_blank">Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</a></em>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">Prometheus legend</a> has several variations, but Shelly's story draws more upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop" target="_blank">Aesop's</a> <a href="http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/oxford/516.htm" target="_blank">version of the story</a>, in which Prometheus makes man from clay and water. Prometheus' creation, which violated the process for how life is naturally made, rebels against him, and Zeus punishes Prometheus for the unintended consequences of his act.

Last week, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/google-the-xbox-one-is-terrible-bing-the-xbox-one-is-amazing/277012/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlantic</em> reported</a> that Google and Bing seem to be autocompleting different stories about Microsoft’s upcoming game console the Xbox One. On Google, a search for “the Xbox One is” returns autocomplete suggestions for “terrible,” “ugly,” and “a joke.” The same search on Bing, Microsoft’s flagship search engine, returns a single autocomplete suggestion: “amazing.” Commentators on the <em>Atlantic</em> article pointed out that dropping the term “the” from the searches would yield different results and should put to rest any conspiratorial thinking that Google is smearing Microsoft’s product using its autocomplete. A search for “xbox one is” on Google is still pretty negative, suggesting “xbox one issues,” “xbox one is bad” and “xbox one is garbage.” However, Bing’s suggestions are even more scathing. When dropping “the,” Bing seems to agree with Google suggesting “xbox one issues” and “xbox one is bad.” However, it also suggests that Xbox One is “terrible,” “going to fail,” “ugly,” “watching you,” “crap,” and “doomed.”
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-370" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/k-bigpic-1.jpg" alt="" width="776" height="437" />Xbox One isn’t the only product to have an interesting mix of autocomplete suggestions. Autocomplete on Google suggests “google glass is stupid” and “google glass is creepy.” Bing suggests these too, but also suggests that google glass is: “ridiculous," "[a] terrible idea," "military tech," "scary," and "useless.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="wp-image-371 aligncenter" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/ku-xlarge-2.png" alt="" width="518" height="185" />Searching for other tech companies returns interesting results, too. Google suggests that “apple is”: “dying," "evil," "dead," and "doomed,” while Bing suggests the company is: “evil," "losing its cool," "losing," "a cult," "dead," and "going downhill." (On the flip side, Bing’s autocomplete also suggests that Apple is a “good company to work for" and "better than android.”) Meanwhile, Bing’s autocomplete doesn't seem to be advertising Windows 8 very well, suggesting that "windows 8 is:" “terrible," "horrible," "awful," "slow," "awesome," "a disaster," "great," and "crap." These are only a few of the latest examples, but <a href="https://failblog.cheezburger.com/tag/autocomplete-me" target="_blank">FAIL Blog</a> has a great collection of similar autocomplete fails collected by search engine users.</p>
<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-372 alignleft" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/ku-xlarge-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="325" />But what if a person’s name is autocomplete associated with something they might not like? In May 2013, former first lady of Germany <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettina_Wulff" target="_blank">Bettina Wulff</a> successfully <a href="http://kellywarnerlaw.com/german-luminary-slaps-google-with-an-autocomplete-defamation-lawsuit/" target="_blank">sued Google</a> for automatically completing search terms entered into the company's German search engine that associated her name with “escort,” “prostitute,” or “past life.” For years, rumors had been circulating that Wulff had worked as an escort before meeting her husband (and future president) Christian Wulff. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-faces-autocomplete-lawsuit-in-germany-132517" target="_blank">Five similar</a> autocomplete cases have been leveled against Google in Germany, most of which involve associations between a person’s name and terms like “fraud” or “bankruptcy,” and before Wulff, Google had won them all.
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-382" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/wulff1-1024x439.png" alt="" width="584" height="250" />Before Wulff, Google’s main defense had been, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/opinion/sunday/you-cant-say-that-on-the-internet.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;" target="_blank">as explained by the company’s Northern Europe spokesperson</a> Kay Oberbeck, that the predictions come from “algorithmically generated result of objective factors, including the popularity of the entered search terms.” Google argued it was not responsible for simply displaying the mass input of users, but even if German courts had agreed, the marketing departments have some serious work ahead of them.</p>
Despite Google’s assertions that “autocomplete predictions are algorithmically determined based on a number of factors (including popularity of search terms) without any human intervention” and that “objective factors” alone drive the suggestions, Google <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?hl=en" target="_blank">voluntarily and expressly intervenes</a> in autocomplete results to remove hate speech, copyright infringement, and other terms on a country by country basis (for example, searches in German do not show Holocaust denial keywords, but they do appear in searches within the US). While Google had not lost an autocomplete case in Germany before Wulff, it had lost several defamation cases in <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/japanese-man-sues-google-over-autocomplete-search-results-2062305142/" target="_blank">Japan</a>, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/australian-surgeon-sues-google-over-bankrupt-autocomplete-20130122-2d480.html" target="_blank">Australia</a>, and <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/france-sues-google-autocomplete/" target="_blank">France</a>.

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-374 alignleft" style="color: #333333;font-size: 15.199999809265137px;font-style: normal;line-height: 19.200000762939453px;margin-top: 0.4em" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/google-autocomplete.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="109" />

And what if some clever person figured out how to use autocomplete to their advantage? In 2010, Internet marketing expert Brent Payne paid several assistants to search for "Brent Payne manipulated this." Not long after, users typing "Brent P" into Google would see Payne's results in their autocomplete suggestions. When Payne <a href="http://www.beattheautocomplete.com/" target="_blank">advertised what he had done</a>, Google removed the suggestion.

Payne’s manipulation of Google’s autocomplete and Google’s own reaction should indicate that the algorithms built to guide and direct us through the Web are neither infallible nor incorruptible. In several countries, algorithm creators have been held responsible for the actions of their autocompleting creations. At the same time, decisions to intervene in the operation of algorithms can be viewed as censorship or an abuse of power. Shelly borrowed the term "Modern Prometheus" from Immanuel Kant's description of Benjamin Franklin's <a href="http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/2006/benjamin-franklin/" target="_blank">contemporary experiments with electricity</a>. When the creators of algorithms can be held responsible for the defamation of their creation, by legal institutions or consumers, those creators are forced to accept the successes, limitations, and failures of their experiments with electronic discourse.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://international.radiobubble.gr/2013/06/greece-government-wants-to-shut-down.html">On June 11,</a> signals for the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation, known as ERT, went silent. Immediately after the government-ordered blackout, Greek journalists, many of whom had just lost their jobs, staged a 24-hour strike, refused to leave ERT headquarters, and continued to report the news on the Internet through the European Broadcasting Union, which is maintaining ERT's radio and television frequencies via live stream on the <a href="http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/monitor-ert-online.html">EUB website</a>.

Stating that ERT needed to save money and restructure, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s government suspended operations at the public network (comprised of 19 regional channels, four national channels—one that broadcast abroad—six radio stations, a TV guide magazine, websites and the national audiovisual archives). Plans were announced to reopen later in 2013 under the new name Hellenic Radio, Internet, and Television (NERIT). A blogger at <a href="http://troktiko.eu/category/blog/">Troktiko</a> said in a <a href="http://www.omantribune.com/index.php?page=news&amp;id=146358&amp;heading=Europe">news report</a>, “We registered the domain name www.nerit.gr as soon as the new name was announced.”  The blog's name means rodent in Greek and is a popular news source in Greece with an intriguing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Sokratis_Giolias">history</a> and a reputation for hard-hitting investigative journalism.

[caption id="attachment_437" align="alignleft" width="225"]<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/nerit-picture.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-437 " src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/06/nerit-picture-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a> Screen shot from www.NERIT.gr on June 12. “It’s not just about ERT, it’s about democracy.” Photo credit: Leigh Graham[/caption]

Members of the Greek blogosphere were delighted and amused with the news, suggesting the <a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_13/06/2013_504202">government's failure to register the domain name</a> before publicly announcing it showed <a href="http://www.omantribune.com/index.php?page=news&amp;id=146358&amp;heading=Europe">"how pathetic they are."</a> Internet users visiting NERIT.gr, before it was surreptitiously taken down, received live stream news, a ghoulish meme face, and the message: “It’s not just about ERT, it’s about democracy.” They were also redirected to the blog <a href="http://pitsaria-pou-eskise.gr/">pitsaria-pou-eskise</a>. This blog’s name is a riff on Samaras’s suggestion <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lkW0elQUCg">in an interview</a> last year that his business experience running a pizzeria during his college days in America had prepared him to run the country. Pitsaria pou eskise is a colloquialism and translates roughly as “the pizzeria did extremely well or was a massive hit.” Samaras's awkward attempt to relate to the people was quickly picked up by bloggers and turned into a taunt. <a href="http://troktiko.eu/2013/06/anakoinosi-tou-troktiko-eu-gia-ti-diakopi-leitourgias-tou-nerit/">NERIT.gr has been taken down</a>, but pitsaria-pou-eskise.gr is still up and doing extremely well. 

The days following the shutdown may have been a score for Greek netizens; yet, citizens on the ground were <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/international/shock-as-greece-shuts/707136.html">shocked and suffering</a>. More than 2,500 people lost their jobs, and many people living in rural villages and remote islands where ERT is the sole source of outside information were cut off from current news as well as cultural programming.

The blackout of a national broadcaster, massive layoffs, and the isolation of entire communities of citizens are troubling events, and both professional and citizen journalists swiftly responded with collective voice and clear demands. Internet-based citizen media has been developing in Greece for a while. <a href="http://www.radiobubble.gr/">Radio Bubble</a> is a good example. Operated out of a café in Athens, it is a mixed-media network of websites, radio channels, blogs, Twitter, and other online sources that blurs boundaries between being a member of a community on the Internet, on the air and on the streets. In classic power-to-the-people style, Radio Bubble exists to report underreported news in real time through the unfiltered lenses of tech-savvy, everyday activists. Radio Bubble also runs a program called <a href="http://www.hackademy.gr/">Hackademy</a>teaching citizen journalism skills such as using smartphones to interview and document real-time events, using laptops to edit films, and using social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to post real-time reporting. Hackademy also offers courses on how to verify stories and authenticate sources.

In light of political corruption and economic turmoil presently crippling the country, many Greeks have lost faith in traditional media. Though many favor cuts in the public sector, including trimming within the notoriously mismanaged ERT, they are not pleased with the way things were handled. Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law, economics and legal theory at the University of Athens told reporters “the ERT debacle illustrates the <a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2013/06/24/feature-01">government's lack of respect for the rule of law."</a> In response, Greek citizens took to the streets in protest, and <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/greece-hit-with-general/709248.html">unions</a> launched a strike that throttled transportation and everyday business.  Their outrage also filled Internet channels.

In addition to galvanizing local citizens and members of the Greek diaspora, online reporters, Twitter users, and bloggers relentlessly demanded redress from Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. To this end, both citizen activists and opposition parties have achieved some gains. On June 17, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jun/18/greek-broadcaster-ert-court-reopen">ERT was ordered to reopen </a>but has not resumed broadcasting. <a href="http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/les-medias-de-service-public-eur.html">The EUB website reports,</a> “The Council of State ordered the Greek government to restore the ERT signal and take all appropriate organizational measures to continue broadcasting through the ERT frequencies and Internet sites until a new public service broadcaster is established.” Ramifications from the ERT shutdown and stalled reopening are sure to play out for weeks, months, maybe even years to come. The outcome remains to be seen; however, one thing is certain: the Internet and citizen media have been irrevocably cast as lead actors in Greece’s continuing political drama.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A Pennsylvania detective had a nickname of a suspect, but no real name. He turned to Facebook, found a picture, and eventually apprehended the person. This anecdote from a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/state-photo-id-databases-become-troves-for-police/2013/06/16/6f014bd4-ced5-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html"><em>Washington Post</em> investigation</a> into law enforcement use of facial recognition software illustrates how social media can be a boon for catching criminals.

As people share more about their thoughts and actions on social media and as algorithms grow more sophisticated, law enforcement’s ability to mine such information for clues into how to prevent crimes raises concerns of profiling and questions of oversight.

Law enforcement profiling predates social media. From 1956 to 1971, FBI counterintelligence program <a href="http://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro">COINTELPRO</a> tracked <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2013/06/prism_j_edgar_hoover_would_have_loved_the_nsa_s_surveillance_program_topic.html">political organizations and their leaders</a>, including Martin Luther King, Jr.

Recently, the ACLU’s “Mapping the FBI” project uncovered intelligence gathering that used <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform-racial-justice-national-security/shhhh-what-fbi-doesnt-want-you-know-about">racial and ethnic mapping</a>. The project's documentation includes a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/fbimappingfoia/20111019/ACLURM011609.pdf">2009 memo</a> from the bureau’s Detroit office that called Michigan’s Middle East and Muslim community “prime territory for attempted radicalization and recruitment by” terrorist groups. The FBI’s reason: most State Department-labeled terrorist groups originate in the Middle East and South Asia.

In 2010 a 20-year-old Arab-American man in California <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/10/fbi-tracking-device/all/">found a tracking device on his car</a> and learned the FBI had been surveilling him, a US citizen, for months, if not longer. Since 2011 the Associated Press has <a href="http://www.ap.org/Index/AP-In-The-News/NYPD">investigated</a> the NYPD’s spying on Muslim communities, documenting what <em>The Atlantic</em> calls “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/03/the-horrifying-effects-of-nypd-ethnic-profiling-on-innocent-muslim-americans/274434/">horrifying effects</a>” on both those surveilled, who have not been accused of any crimes, and on counterterrorism efforts as a whole—in six years, the program did not generate a single lead.

The <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-data-collection-faq/">NSA</a> and British intelligence agency <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa">GCHQ</a> collect raw Internet traffic that includes email, social media, and chats. US law enforcement agencies at all levels can obtain information from Internet and communication companies with court orders. But police don’t need permission to monitor what already flows freely on the web. <em>Ars Technica</em> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/meet-prisms-little-brother-socmint/">reported</a> on the London Metropolitan police’s extensive efforts to monitor social media:

<blockquote>For the past two years, a secretive unit in the Metropolitan Police has been developing the tools for blanket surveillance of the public's social media conversations. Operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, a staff of 17 officers in the National Domestic Extremism Unit (NDEU) has been scanning the public's tweets, YouTube videos, Facebook profiles, and anything else UK citizens post in the public online sphere.</blockquote>

Several commercial tools exist to monitor social media streams, and companies <a href="http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/private-tech-companies-pitch-web-surveillance-tools-police-17846">actively market them to law enforcement</a>.  Police departments at the University of Maryland, Hampton University, and the city of Boca Raton, Florida <a href="http://www.ecmuniverse.com/news/default.aspx">use tools</a> from the Virginia-based technology company ECM Universe to surveil social media users and analyze the text of their messages. A <a href="http://www.ecmuniverse.com/products/ECM_Universe_Law_Enforcement_IBM_Solution_Profile.pdf">brochure</a> touts that with the tool,

<blockquote>[A] city can monitor activist groups who are using social media to organize their efforts on the ground and receive alerts in a matter of minutes from the time of the postings when dangerous radical elements emerge from the crowd.</blockquote>

Such language underscores the need for oversight on how to use information gathered from social media. Participating in an activist group is not a criminal activity, and “dangerous radical elements” do not emerge at every activist meeting.

US law enforcement generally needs a reason and court permission to investigate someone. Predictive analytics involves mining data to look for undetected or unconsidered patterns. Agencies “don’t necessarily know what they need to monitor on Twitter,” software company SAS <a href="http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings12/309-2012.pdf">wrote</a> in a paper detailing its tools, one of which maps people’s friends and followers on Facebook and Twitter. Users maintain hundreds of connections on these sites, including people they may not have contacted for years or people they don’t even know. To what extent will a person's connections implicate them?

Predictive policing has <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/2013/April/predictive-policing-using-technology-to-reduce-crime">helped</a> police departments lower crime. But such efforts used previously reported and anonymized crime data; inclusion of social media data adds another dimension of concern. People don’t know what governments are doing with troves of social media data, and people can’t see the algorithms that police use to fight crime. As Evgeny Morozov <a href="http://www.zcommunications.org/how-facebook-could-get-you-arrested-by-evgeny-morozov">wrote</a>, “If no one can examine the algorithms...we won't know what biases and discriminatory practices are built into them.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>North &amp; South Korea</strong>
Hackers brought down several government and news websites in North and South Korea on June 25, the anniversary of the start of the Korean War. Online security company Symantec <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/27/darkseoul-hacking-group-4-years-cyberattacks-south-korea/">traced parts of this attack</a>, as well as four years of cyberattacks on South Korea, to the DarkSeoul Gang. Symantec <a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war">could not determine</a> where the group is based, but a South Korean <a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/04/11/2013041100648.html">government investigation</a> points to North Korea. It is unclear who is responsible for the attacks that hit North Korea on Tuesday, but the hacker group Anonymous <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/world/asia/cyberattacks-shut-down-leading-korean-sites.html?_r=0">had said via Twitter</a> it would attack sites in that country, according to the New York Times.

<strong>Bahrain</strong>
A Bahraini court <a href="http://bahrainrights.org/en/node/6198#.Uc1Yj6B-mdo.twitter">sentenced</a> 17-year-old high school student Ali Faisal Alshofa to one year in prison after accusing him of posting a tweet that insulted the country’s king on the account <a href="https://twitter.com/alkawarahnews">@alkawarahnews</a>. Alshofa denied affiliation with the Twitter account, which appeared to keep operating while he was detained and on trial. Over the past year, courts have sentenced twelve people in Bahrain to a total of 106 months in prison for information posted to social network sites.

<strong>Taiwan</strong>
Taiwanese netizens <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/26/taiwan-internet-policy-reforms-spark-fears-of-censorship/">are protesting</a> several amendments that could make it easier for the government to censor online content. A Copyright Act amendment would allow Taiwan’s IP office to review content reported as infringing copyright and order ISPs to block it. A National Security Law amendment would encourage people to report content they think harms national security. An amendment to the Telecommunications Act would also require ISPs to remove content that “disturbs public order and decent morals.” Bloggers compared these measures to the U.S. SOPA bill that Congress proposed in 2012 as well as the U.S. Department of Justice’s  investigation into Aaron Swartz, surveillance of the Associated Press, and prosecution of Bradley Manning.

<strong>Ecuador</strong>
Several provisions in a communication law that Ecuador’s National Assembly passed in June <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/19/ecuador-passes-controversial-communications-law/">worry</a> journalists and others concerned with freedom of expression. One article <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2013/06/27/mixed-bag-for-freedom-of-expression-in-ecuadors-new-communications-law">appears</a> to lump together every type of media organization (e.g., public, private, and community organizations that provide any type of mass communication that can be replicated online) under the same regulations. Broad interpretation could hold a tweet to the same standards as a radio broadcast. While the law prohibits censorship, it also tasks a Superintendent’s Office for Information and Communications with overseeing the media. Finally, the law holds third parties accountable for comments posted on their site unless site owners monitor comments or require users to identify themselves.

Last week, the Indian government made the <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-26/internet/40205551_1_isps-websites-urls" target="_blank">controversial decision to ban</a> several websites that allow users to share porn online. While watching pornography is not illegal in India (except child pornography), the decision has required Internet service providers to block 39 websites, most of them web forums used mainly to share and store non-pornographic files. The <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/To-watch-or-not-to-watch-porn/articleshow/20808021.cms" target="_blank">decision has been criticized</a> as being an overreach by the government and as demonstrating the government's interest in regulating what people watch on the Web.

The decision is strikingly reminiscent of a similar decision made by the <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/2004/Aug/103798.htm" target="_blank">Chinese government in 2004</a>. China required ISPs and websites to sign a self-disciplinary act to stamp out online pornography, and the government shut down 700 sites, arresting more than 200 people in connection with online porn. In an odd reversal of position, during the 2010 anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989" target="_blank">Tienanmen Square protests</a>, China suddenly unblocked thousands of porn sites. <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/91193/china-unblocks-internet-porn.html" target="_blank">Some speculated</a> the government unblocked the sites to calm some of the discontent felt by citizens and distract them from any possible political action.China may have been onto something in using online porn to prevent riots in the street. Last week on Monday night, during the final game of the Stanley Cup, <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/blog/eye-on-hockey/22524719/chart-boston-turns-to-porn-after-game-6-loss-in-stanley-cup-final" target="_blank">statisticians at the adult website Pornhub</a> kept hour-by-hour tabs on incoming traffic to their site. After the Boston Bruins were defeated by the Chicago Blackhawks, Pornhub noticed a 21% spike in traffic incoming from Boston after the game, with significantly below average traffic coming from Chicago. While Chicagoans were celebrating winning their first Stanley Cup in four years, some Boston fans consoled themselves online.

Regulating Internet pornography has been an issue in the United States since the advent of the World Wide Web, something made explicit in the short-lived 1996 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act" target="_blank">Communications Decency Act</a>. The issue of Internet pornography recently reappeared in Congress during the December 2011 debates over the Stop Online Piracy Act (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act" target="_blank">SOPA</a>) when Rep. Jared Polis entered the lyrics from a popular YouTube clip into the official record. The lyrics came from <em>Avenue Q</em>, a musical parody of Sesame Street, in which a woman tries to explain the Internet to a group of puppets. The clip—titled “<a href="http://youtu.be/T-TA57L0kuc" target="_blank">The Internet is For Porn</a>”—went viral on YouTube. During the charged debate, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57344507-281/internet-is-for-porn-pops-up-during-house-sopa-debate/" target="_blank">Polis declared</a> that “a high percentage” of the Internet is used for porn and labeled the Web “a pornographer’s wet dream!”

Statistics differ on how much of the Internet is devoted to porn. In 2011, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/julieruvolo/2011/09/07/how-much-of-the-internet-is-actually-for-porn/" target="_blank">Forbes estimated</a> that approximately 4% of the world’s websites are devoted to porn, but other estimates suggest that <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/123929-just-how-big-are-porn-sites" target="_blank">at least one third of all online traffic</a> is pornography. Additionally, an <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/123929-just-how-big-are-porn-sites" target="_blank">ExtremeTech article</a> last year found that the porn site YouPorn hosts over 100TB of porn and serves up an average of 950 terabytes of data transfer each day. Based on the number of visits, the largest porn site on the web, Xvideos, <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/123929-just-how-big-are-porn-sites" target="_blank">receives approximately 4.4 billion page</a> views per month (which is three times the size of ESPN or CNN and double Reddit's traffic) and streams the equivalent of 10 dual-layer DVDs every second. And while most websites are lucky to keep viewers for 3-6 minutes per visit, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5899327/how-much-porn-does-the-internet-hold" target="_blank">porn sites average 15-20 minutes</a> per visit.

Porn has a long history with digital technologies and has been part of the Internet from the beginning. Before the World Wide Web, pornographic images had been <a href="http://www.salon.com/2001/06/04/handheld_pr0n/" target="_blank">sent over the Internet</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art" target="_blank">ASCII art</a>, which consisted of pictures composed of 95 keyboard characters to form a text based visual composition. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup" target="_blank">Usenet groups</a> made sharing images over the narrow bandwidth of the 1990s possible. These images were often scans of adult magazines, which could be downloaded for free, and anonymously. Even earlier, researchers developing digital scanning and laying the foundations for the JPEG format in the 1970s—funded by the Pentagon in connection with the Internet predecessor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a>—<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf" target="_blank">scanned a copy</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_S%C3%B6derberg" target="_blank">Lena Söderberg's</a> 1972 <em>Playboy</em> photo shoot. In 1997, Söderberg was even invited to be a special guest at the 50th anniversary of conference of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology in Boston. The ubiquity of her electronic photograph has earned her the title of "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19260550" target="_blank">first lady of the Internet</a>" from the BBC.

Among other things, the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/155745/porn_on_the_web.html" target="_blank">porn industry has played a key role in many innovations</a> on the Internet that have become staples of the everyday online experience, including online payment systems, spam, streaming content, malware, live chat, pop-ups, traffic optimization, affiliate marketing, and <a href="http://www.askingsmarterquestions.com/porns-innovatoins-in-advertising-digital-media/" target="_blank">geo-location software</a>. In the 1990s, <em>Penthouse</em> magazine <a href="http://exhibitmag.com/porn-technology/" target="_blank">sponsored the development of broadband</a> by giving away free modems.

<div></div>
Outside of technological innovations, online porn has also caused some social innovations. Recognizing the appeal of online pornography, a Norwegian nonprofit organization called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_for_Forests" target="_blank">F*ck for Forest</a> became the <a href="http://grist.org/article/harris-naked/" target="_blank">first eco-porn organization</a>, raising money for rain forest protection by selling online porn it produces.

Online pornography has also influenced the development of electronic censorship and circumvention tools designed to get around censorship. <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-26/internet/40205551_1_isps-websites-urls" target="_blank">In response</a> to the Indian government's recent decision to block porn sites, the director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Internet_and_Society_(India)" target="_blank">Centre for Internet and Society</a> in Bangladore, Suni Abraham, argued "I have traveled to China and Middle East and have seen that people access pornographic websites using various web tools. In fact, by banning websites the governments have made it more alluring for users to watch and access pornography." Governments clearly have an interest in regulating pornography, especially when its production or distribution takes advantage of vulnerable populations like children, but broadly blocking access to online porn may cause governments more trouble than it's worth. The Internet is widely thought of as a tool for education, economic development, and civic engagement. Given the history of online pornography, it may be worth reconsidering the idea that the Internet really is, and maybe always has been, for porn.]]></content:encoded>

On June 14, 2013, Google announced that it would begin sending experimental balloons, loaded down with Internet hotspot equipment, into the stratosphere to help connect the <a href="http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf" target="_blank">estimated 4.5 billion people</a> who do not have access to the Internet, many of whom live in rural areas. Google’s project, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Loon" target="_blank">named “Loon,”</a> quickly grabbed the attention and imagination of people living in countries where Internet censorship is the norm. <a href="http://www.wamda.com/2012/10/developing-mobile-and-web-games-abdullah-hamed-of-gametako-wamda-tv" target="_blank">Abdullah Hamed</a>, CEO and founder of the popular Saudi gaming platform GameTako, reacted to Google’s announcement by posing a provoking question (or taunt) to local Emirati telecom companies and the Saudi government on Twitter.
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="size-full wp-image-521 aligncenter" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/indie_saudi_tweet.png" alt="" width="512" height="116" /></p>
Hamed’s question was a good one to put to the Saudi government and telecom companies who regularly <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/06/13/government-bird-dogs-on-the-loose-in-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank">block websites and ban unsanctioned communications services</a> such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viber" target="_blank">VoIP product Viber</a>. Hamed’s question soon got an answer, but not from the Saudi government or any other state that censors its Internet; Hamed was <a href="http://www.wamda.com/2013/06/project-loon-google-answers-our-questions-about-its-%E2%80%98internet-for-everyone" target="_blank">answered by Google</a>. The company announced that it would be obtaining all the proper air travel permissions and radio frequency licenses, and will connect with local telecom networks as its balloons float by.

In the late 1970s, small numbers of Iranians were permitted into Iraq to worship at the shrine of Imam Ali. After most of the pilgrims left the shrine, the exiled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayatollah_Ruhollah_Khomeini" target="_blank">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</a> would give impassioned anti-Shah lectures to the remaining visitors. Khomeini’s speeches were recorded onto cassette tapes, copied, and widely distributed on the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities. The Shah's government was aware of the tapes, and often destroyed copies it could find, but it did not manage to sufficiently disrupt the distribution network, and Khomeini’s influence in Iran grew. The CIA and the Shah's information intelligence communities, looking in the wrong places, failed to see that the ground beneath them had shifted and were caught by surprise when the Iranian Revolution ousted the Shah's government. In today’s increasingly connected world, we would call Khomeini’s followers members of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank">“sneakernet.”</a> A sneakernet refers to the transfer of electronic information like computer files using removable media like magnetic tape, floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, USB flash drives, and external hard drives by someone wearing sneakers.  While sneakernets do still exist, many hung up their sneakers once broadband made sharing files faster and easier.

Hamed’s excited tweet expressed his hope that floating balloons would connect people to the Internet and thwart government censorship policies. Instead of investing his hopes in Google Loon, Hamed might take seriously a proposal from the early days of the Internet that seems loonier than Google Loon, but might be more practical for circumventing network censorship or avoiding government scrutiny by programs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)" target="_blank">like PRISM</a> or the recently discovered <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/monitoring-of-snail-mail.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB&amp;_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">snooping via the US Postal Service</a>: IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC). On April Fool’s Day, 1990, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149" target="_blank">David Waitzman</a> submitted a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank">Request for Comments</a> (RFC) to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force" target="_blank">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>, the ad hoc body charged with developing and promoting Internet standards, on the idea of using carrier pigeons or other birds for the transmission of electronic data. Nine years later, again on April 1<sup>st</sup>, Waitzman <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549" target="_blank">issued another RFC</a> suggesting improvements to his original protocol. On April 1, 2011, Brian Carpenter and Robert Hinden made <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149" target="_blank">their own RFC</a> detailing how to use IPoAC with the latest revisions to the Internet Protocol IPv6.  While Waitzman, Carpenter, and Hinden clearly designed IPoAC as a joke, using birds to transfer digital media has been successfully tested. In 2004, inspired by the IPoAC idea, the Bergen Linux group <a href="http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/writeup.html" target="_blank">sent nine pigeons</a>, each carrying a single ping, three miles. (They only received four “responses,” meaning only four of the birds made it.)

Not all the tests have ended in failure. In 2009, a South African marketing company targeted South Africa's largest Internet Service provider, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkom_(South_Africa)" target="_blank">Telkom</a>, for its slow ADSL speeds <a href="http://phys.org/news171883994.html" target="_blank">by racing a pigeon</a> carrying a 4 GB memory stick against the upload of the same amount of data using Telkom's service. After six minutes and 57 seconds, the pigeon arrived, easily beating Telkcom, which had only transferred 4 percent of the data in the same amount of time. In 2010, another person hoping to shame their ISP in Yorkshire, England <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/09/carrier-pigeons-beat-rural-internet-upload-speeds/" target="_blank">raced a five-minute video on a memory card</a> to a BBC correspondent 75 miles away using a carrier pigeon while simultaneously attempting to upload the same clip to YouTube. The pigeon made it in 90 minutes, well ahead of the YouTube video—which failed once during the race. In Fort Collins, Colorado, rafting photographers <a href="http://origin.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_6209735" target="_blank">routinely use pigeons</a> to carry memory sticks from their cameras to tour operators over 30 miles away, and prisoners in Brazil have been caught using <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29980598/ns/world_news-weird_news/t/pigeons-smuggle-cell-phones-brazil-prison/" target="_blank">pigeons to smuggle cellphones</a> into their prison cells.

Suggesting that pigeons might be faster than Internet connections might seem ridiculous, but as the information density of storage media has increased, and continues to increase, many times faster than the Internet bandwidth available to move it, IPoAC might not be so far-fetched. <a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/02/sneakernet-beats-internet.html" target="_blank">Over the last 20 years</a>, the available storage space of hard disks of the same physical size has increased roughly 100 percent per year, while the capacity of Internet connections has only increase by 30-40 percent each year. Sneakernets might have gone out of fashion as bandwidth speeds increased, but as storage capacity increases—along with our need to fill those capacities—pigeon-powered networks may become a practical alternative to existing networks. While no one brought up the idea of using pigeons at Google’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/events/howgreenistheinternet2013/" target="_blank">How green is the Internet?</a>” summit last month, pigeons may also be a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way to transfer data in the future.

Even if the increasing gap between storage and mobility doesn't become a problem, Internet censorship or privacy issues might spur the development of a Pigeonet. Earlier this month <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Judge" target="_blank">Anthony Judge</a>, who worked from the 1960s until 2007 for the UN’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_International_Associations" target="_blank">Union of International Associations</a> and is known for developing the most extensive databases on global civil society, published a detailed proposal titled “<a href="http://www.laetusinpraesens.org/musings/pigeon.php" target="_blank">Circumventing Invasive Internet Surveillance with Carrier Pigeons</a>.” In the proposal, Judge discusses the proven competence of carrier pigeons for delivering messages, their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_post" target="_blank">non-military and military messaging</a> capacity, and the history of using pigeons to transfer digital data. Judge acknowledges that pigeon networks have their own susceptibilities (such as disease or being lured off course by an attractive decoy), but argues we should not be so quick to dismiss the idea. As governments, and compliant corporations, increasingly block or filter access to the Internet, data capacities and data production increase beyond bandwidth limitations, and we begin to realize the <a href="http://www.techthefuture.com/technology/how-much-electricity-does-the-internet-use/" target="_blank">environmental costs of running the Internet</a>, sneakernets and pigeonets may become increasingly attractive options for transmitting data.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hundreds of protesters gathered in cities across the United States and Europe last week as part of the "Restore the Fourth" rallies aimed to call attention to government surveillance. The non-partisan organization <a href="http://www.restorethefourth.net/">Restore the Fourth</a> coordinated protests online and in person against what they deem to be unconstitutional digital surveillance in the United States, including the NSA's PRISM program.

The grassroots movement, which initially galvanized support on Reddit, aims to end all forms of unconstitutional surveillance of digital communications in the United States. To do so, the group <a href="http://www.restorethefourth.net/press/">endorses</a> the <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and StopWatching.us stance, calling for reforms to the USA Patriot Act, the creation of a special committee to report and publicly reveal the extent of domestic spying, and to hold any public officials responsible for unconstitutional surveillance accountable for their actions.

Rallies of varying sizes gathered in 100 cities across the United Sates, as well as in <a href="https://twitter.com/farddizzle/status/352781384630288384">Munich</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thinnairr/status/352981065008291840">London</a>. More than four hundred gathered in Washington DC and in New York. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian posted a <a href="https://vine.co/v/hW5LWrVdXQO">Vine video</a> of the New York protest, which gathered in Union Square. A few hundred protestors <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/04/restore-the-fourth-protesters-nsa-surveillance">gathered in San Francisco</a>, reported <em>The Guardian</em>, peacefully making their way down Market Street.

Participants primarily heard about the event online, media spokesperson Douglas MacArthur told <em>The Guardian</em>. As live protests gathered in streets across the country and in Europe, thousands of websites held concurrent protests online. Internet Defense League members including Reddit, WordPress, and Boingboing displayed <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TZ2Myrl.png">anti-NSA banner ads</a> on their sites. On Twitter, the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23restorethe4th&amp;src=typd">#Restorethe4th</a> hashtag gained visibility for news related to the protests and to NSA surveillance more generally.

Now that the fourth of July is over, what comes next for the movement? MacArthur emphasized in an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hijib/we_are_the_national_organization_of_restore_the/">AMA (online interview) on Reddit</a> that the movement was never about a single protest, but about galvanizing support and awareness of the organization's goals to curb surveillance. When asked when the next protest would be held on Reddit, a New York City rally co-organizer <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hv2i3/when_is_the_next_protest_date/caya8n9">announced August 4th (8/4)</a> as New York's next rally date and suggested a worldwide "1984" day, after George Orwell's dystopian classic.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Egypt</strong>
As of July 3, President Mohamed Morsi is out of office, but much of the Western world is still not sure about <a href="http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/12624/why-the-western-media-are-getting-egypt-wrong">what happened in Egypt and why</a>. Was it a coup d'état or not? Wikipedia is calling it the “2013 Egyptian coup d'état,” but whether the term fits is being contested. <em>Foreign Policy</em> blogger Marya Hannun <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/07/the_wikipedia_war_over_egypts_coup">breaks down the Wikipedia edit war</a> surrounding Morsi’s ousting. So-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars">wiki-wars</a> over acceptable phraseology and editing have been waged before.  Relatedly: viewing events in Egypt from a <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/WeGov/24134/ouster-egyptian-president-seen-social-media">social media perspective</a> offers valuable insight into how social media and networking sites, namely YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, factor into current political discourse and social change. For example, the opposition group, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/27/tamarod-egypt-morsi-campaign-oppsition-resignation">Tamarod</a>, enlisted a range of media platforms to shape its campaign and gather more than <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/tamarod-petition-has-22-million-signatures">20 million signatures</a> leading up to demonstration calling for Morsi’s removal.

<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/06/30/311578/s-arabia-criticized-for-activist-sentences/">being criticized</a> for harsh sentences recently handed down for <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/29/saudi-arabia-7-convicted-facebook-postings-about-protests">seven cyber activists arrested</a> in 2011 for Facebook posts. The men were accused of joining and using Facebook with the intention of starting protests. Political gatherings and public protests are prohibited in Saudi Arabia. The men were charged with crimes including illegal information gathering and “breaking allegiance with the king.” Abd al-Hamid al-Amer received 10 years in jail, the longest sentence. Other defendants&mdash;Ali Ali al-Hadlaq, Hussein Mohammed al-Bathir, Mostafa Hussein al-Mujahad, Mohammed Abd a-Hadi al-Khalifa, Hussein Yasin al-Sulayman, and Saleh Ali al-Shaya&mdash;received lesser sentences. The men also lost the right to travel freely within and outside the kingdom (rights that men are usually given freely in Saudi Arabia), and restrictions were placed on their future freedom of expression, including bans on public speaking and writing. 

<strong>China</strong>
On July 1, the Chinese government instituted <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/24122/chinas-new-petitioning-platform-let-hundred-flowers-bloom%E2%80%A6online">an online petitioning system</a> intended to update its centuries-old petitioning custom. The website is intended to enable citizens to post petitions and air grievances concerning issues such as forced evictions, pollution, or corruption. However, as soon as the site was launched, it crashed. The response was great enough&mdash;beyond government expectations and the website’s capacity&mdash;to result in a shutdown that <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/02/china_petitions_site_crashes/">sparked excited debate</a> about the cause. Some Weibo users suggested the crash was an act of censorship. <a href="http://weibotrends.com/">WeiboSuite</a>, a platform created by students at Hong Kong University interested in Internet censorship, reports the government has been monitoring and removing citizens’ posts from the petition site. The official government response is that it underestimated response rates and the website was simply overwhelmed.

<strong>Pakistan</strong>
A Lahore High Court has <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-05/internet/40390671_1_youtube-ban-pakistani-court-interim-order">rejected an interim order</a> to restore YouTube services across the country. <a href="http://content.bytesforall.pk/">Bytes for All</a>, an NGO dedicated to ICTs for development, democracy, and social justice, filed the petition several months ago. In September 2012, the Pakistan People’s Party government banned the video-sharing site in response to widespread public outrage about the dissemination of a film deemed blasphemous for taking offensive positions against the Prophet. YouTube was banned after its parent company, Google, denied official requests to take down the film. Pakistan’s religious communities and members of the information technology sector remain deep in debate as to how the county will regulate the Internet so as to uphold Islamic values as well as citizen’s rights. Saad Rassol, a lawyer from Lahore, <a href="http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/07/07/comment/columns/youtube-and-internet-freedom/">explains in a post for Pakistan Today,</a> “It is not simply a question of whether YouTube should be unblocked because it serves an academic or social purpose. It is a question of whether we preserve individual freedoms, and discourse, even at the cost of being offended by the words of the speaker, from time to time. Or will we descend into becoming a society where subjective morality and religious sensitivities become a sword to silence tongues and stamp out all debate.”

<p dir="ltr">Imagine walking down the street. Above, you see a surveillance camera mounted on a pole. Would you worry? What if a person walked over and filmed you, no questions asked?</p>
<p dir="ltr">An anonymous man in his late 20s has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SurveillantCameraMan?feature=watch">posted</a> five “Surveillance Camera Man” videos in which he <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2012/10/31/who-is-seattles-creepy-cameraman/">films people on Seattle streets</a> and inside cars, stores, and classrooms, to the ire of those on camera. The videos raise questions about expectations of privacy in an age where institutions and individuals can easily and legally record others. Removal of the videos on various sites also highlights free speech and copyright concerns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cameraman and a friend began filming others as a social experiment, but he went solo after his friend couldn’t keep a straight face, according to an <a href="http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2012/11/05/creepy-cameraman-reponds-to-pinac-interview-then-recants/">email interview</a> posted on the blog <em>Photography Is Not a Crime</em>. His first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CONgeNlxVug">video</a> included forays into classrooms at the University of Washington. He posted the video on Vimeo, but the site took it down after a complaint from the university, the cameraman said. He expressed nonchalance at people calling the police on him, saying he doesn’t care about the legality of his actions. (He appears to care about copyright, as video embeds on <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/seattles-creepy-cameraman-pushes-limits-public-surveillance/">GeekWire</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/11/02/surveillance-camera-man-wants.html">BoingBoing</a>, and <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/surveillance-camera-man-is-filming-people-in-seattle-without-permission/">Laughing Squid</a> are unavailable due to copyright claims.)</p>


[caption id="attachment_621" align="alignleft" width="192"]<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/3812471319_c7b5a7cc80.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-621   " src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/3812471319_c7b5a7cc80.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="144" /></a> <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pursuethepassion/3812471319/">Brett Farmiloe/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</a>[/caption]
<p dir="ltr">When people in the videos asked what he was doing, the cameraman often remained quiet or said, “I'm just taking a video.” When they asked why, he occasionally responded, “Why not?” His casual tone and terse responses quickly frustrated and angered people, some of whom hurled expletives or tried to cover the camera. Several threatened to call the police; the cameraman left only when some began dialing. He also left if people became aggressive, often telling them to calm down as he backed away.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some articulated their feelings without resorting to profanity. “I may be in a public space, but I feel threatened by you,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP3N_nUcilI">said</a> one man wearing what resembled a guard or law enforcement uniform. And while the cameraman appeared to do nothing more than hold the camera and occasionally speak, GeekWire <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2013/youtube-pulls-latest-creepy-cameraman-video-citing-harassment-policy/">reported</a> that YouTube took down one video based on a policy that prohibits material meant to “harass, threaten, or bully.” YouTube appeared to reverse the decision, as the video is now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz8PdALdQDI">accessible</a>.</p>


[caption id="attachment_619" align="alignright" width="146"]<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/279865720_e9ea6401f8.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-619  " src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/279865720_e9ea6401f8.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="204" /></a> <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/gavinandrewstewart/279865720">Gavin Steward/Flickr, CC BY 2.0</a>[/caption]
<p dir="ltr">Some people mentioned they did not consent to the taping. “You didn’t ask me if you could take a picture of me sir,” one woman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP3N_nUcilI">said</a>. “You still have me on camera, and that’s not OK with me. That’s an invasion of my privacy and my time.” The cameraman occasionally referenced the prevalence of surveillance cameras, but he didn’t belabor the point, which was, “blurred by the fact that he sometimes invades his subjects' personal space, making it unclear whether the discomfort they exhibit comes from having a person standing right by them, or whether it's the camera they object to,” <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/11/02/surveillance-camera-man-wants.html">wrote</a> Cory Doctorow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cameraman’s actions appear to be legal. People can typically record in public areas such as sidewalks and parks without consent since no general expectation of privacy exists in public, <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/practical-tips-avoiding-liability-when-gathering-private-information">according to the Digital Media Law Project</a>. The same usually holds for recording activity that occurs on private property but can be observed from public space. Washington's Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/photographers-guide-privacy/washington">ruled</a> that someone can visibly record conversations in public that others can hear.</p>
While the law may not protect people from recordings in public, people clearly distinguish between who’s doing the recording. Canadian filmmaker Rob Spence, who has a bionic eye with a camera, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/05/eyeborg-idUSL538821320090305">told</a> Reuters in 2009, “In Toronto there are 12,000 cameras. But the strange thing I discovered was that people don't care about the surveillance cameras, they were more concerned about me and my secret camera eye because they feel that is a worse invasion of their privacy."

This comment from Spence, who calls himself the <a href="http://www.eyeborgblog.com/">Eyeborg</a>, brings to mind Google Glass, which has already captured an <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/05/i-filmed-the-first-fight-and-arrest-through-google-glass/">arrest</a> on camera. But since Glass doesn’t explicitly <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/wear-it-well-time-establish-google-glass-etiquette-6C9780067">alert</a> people when it shoots video, perhaps Surveillance Camera Man is inciting a much-needed conversation by forcing people to face the uncomfortable feeling they’re being recorded.

"Rationing the Digital," authored by Internet Monitor contributor Ellery Roberts Biddle, explores Cuba's complex economy of Internet connectivity, how digital expression is regulated in the country, and how recent developments in infrastructure might change the shape of access and use on the island:

<blockquote>Cuba has one of the lowest Internet penetration rates in the Western hemisphere and is routinely ranked among countries with the highest restrictions on Internet use in the world. But within both categories, it is something of a rare bird. 

While the precise number of Internet users in the country is difficult to calculate, it is clear that a lack of infrastructure, combined with economic and political hurdles, has left access to the global Internet out of reach for most Cubans. But this may soon change. This spring, the country’s only telecommunications firm, the state-owned ETECSA, activated two undersea fiber optic cables that are set to drastically increase connection speeds in Cuba; the firm also opened over 100 cybercafes across the island.  Officials have since made public promises to increase access and lower currently exorbitant fees for Internet use. This could fundamentally change the island’s information economy.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>China</strong>
"Put only on back pages… close the comment box." Released last month, the Directives from the Ministry of Truth series revealed a repository of more than 2,600 messages sent from government officials to website editors in China during the last decade. The collection offers a window into the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/jul/10/censoring-news-before-happens-china/">mechanisms and idiosyncrasies</a> behind China's censorship and information filtering systems – including addressing the government's increasingly nuanced mechanism for how, when, and where to present sensitive information, if at all. In pouring over the archive of messages, experts concluded that one of the most fundamental aims of internet censorship and filtering in China is to prevent gatherings of unauthorized groups.

<strong>Nigeria
</strong>Are Nigerian officials positioning themselves to <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/07/12/nigerian-government-to-ramp-up-internet-surveillance/">heighten online surveillance in the country?</a>  Nigeria's Minister of the Interior recently stated the government's intentions to monitor activity online in the name of national security. Earlier this year, <em>The Premium Times of Nigeria</em> reported that the government brokered a $40 million contract with an Israeli software security company to allow widespread monitoring of Nigerian's online activities. The move was met with widespread criticism from Nigerian netizens, worried about the potential of widespread surveillance without the protection of data privacy laws legal provisions for interception. Nigeria's lower house of parliament ordered an immediate halt to the deal.

<strong>Russia
</strong>The Kremlin is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10173645/Kremlin-returns-to-typewriters-to-avoid-computer-leaks.html">taking a step back to take a step forward</a> – ordering nearly $15,000 worth of typewriters to skirt fears of foreign government surveillance, in light of the NSA leaks. Russian officials expressed outrage after the leaks documented surveillance of Russia's leadership at the London G20 meetings. Officials said they were able to deal with the threat.

<strong>Turkey
</strong>For protestors in Turkey – it started with police deploying tear gas and water cannons to disperse their encampments. Now, those threats are beginning to move from the physical world into the digital space, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/online-and-information-control-persists-turkey">reports the EFF.</a> Dozens of social media users have been detained since the protests began in the country, on charges ranging from false information to insulting officials. Users have also been detained for sharing images of police brutality. Meanwhile, officials are using legal controls already at their disposal to potentially tighten the flow of information in the country – one representative called on Twitter to open an office within the country, which would legally give Turkey the right to obtain user data. There is also a push to enact legislation allowing for the removal of any "fake" social media accounts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a joint press conference with President Obama last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel referred to the Internet as “<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/neuland">Neuland</a>”—literally, an “uncharted territory”—in response to a question about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">initial reports</a> of the US National Security Agency’s <a href="http://chillingeffects.org/weather.cgi?WeatherID=774">PRISM program</a>. Specifically, she said the Internet was “new or uncharted territory for all of us.” Merkel’s words immediately became the target of a widespread meme. According to <em>Der Spiegel, </em>#Neuland <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/merkel-neuland-gaff-elicits-ridicule-and-goes-viral-on-twitter-a-906859.html">began trending</a> on Twitter within minutes, and images and gifs that poke fun at Merkel from different angles began circulating shortly thereafter. Some images cast Merkel as a luddite or “Internet granny,” while others depicted her as a futuristic imperialist with designs on the new world.

When people hear the name Richard Dawkins, they might think of the Oxford educated evolutionary biologist, or perhaps the world’s most famous atheist, which he is. But according to Dawkins, he is also the “father of the meme.” In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=GFn-ixX9edg#at=16">Dawkins' recent Just for Hits Talk</a>, he reminds us that he is the man who gave the world the term “meme” and claims he would rather leave behind memes than genes. In his 1976 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Selfish-Gene-Edition-Introduction/dp/0199291152"><em>The Selfish Gene</em>,</a> he used the term to explain the non-genetic transmission of meaning and social habits among human beings. Like genes, memes are replicators, but in the cultural rather than biological sense.  Dawkins claims they spread “blog to blog” rather than “brain to brain.”

In addition to being carriers of culture, memes have a social and political function; they galvanize and mobilize people. We’ve seen this globally over time and more recently in citizen-led protests in <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/06/how-memes-became-best-weapon-against-chinese-internet-censorship/65877/">China</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/06/turkish-protest-has-meme-standing-man/66333/">Turkey</a>, the coup in <a href="http://www.thearabreview.org/egyptian-revolution-30-jun/">Egypt</a>, and civil war in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SyrianRevolutionMemes">Syria</a>. The Neuland meme clearly conveys the frustration that people feel when government representatives and policy makers are out of touch with their needs and everyday experiences. Younger, tech savvy generations around the world are losing patience and respect for leaders with outdated mindsets who lack real-world knowledge and skills. The Neuland meme is an expression of the collective political disenchantment of our day. Its meaning transcends race, class, gender and state boundaries to resonate with citizens around the world, not just with Germans. Seeing Merkel as an Internet granny calls to mind other images that express citizens’ lack of faith in technologically challenged world leaders.

As the population of Internet users increases, questions about how ideas are generated and spread drive communication studies and information sciences forward. More than a decade ago, philosopher Daniel Dennett stated in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_on_dangerous_memes.html">TED talk</a> that “people are surprisingly resistant to applying evolutionary thinking <em>to thinking</em>.” Today, however, the spread of ideas online is often described in biological terms—“going viral” being one of the most prominent—and the Internet’s ecosystem is undeniably lively. Ideas meet and mix and reproduce. They spread across online landscapes remarkably like wildflowers and behave at times like wildfire. There is life on the Internet, but what influences the birth and lifespan of a single meme is still uncertain.

In his Just for Hits Talk, Dawkins argued that a meme one creates “may live on long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.” We know the Twittersphere had a good laugh at the chancellor’s gaff last month, but it remains to be seen how long the effects of #Neuland will last. Angela Merkel is up for reelection in September, and we will find out if the Neuland meme is political terra firma or not. Chancellor Merkel is probably hoping this particular meme will not be her legacy, but that is for German citizens and global netizens to decide.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>How Facebook Can Prompt Real-Life Action</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This is a guest post.</em>

Given its role in the Arab Spring, many people have emphasized Facebook as an effective tool for online activism. There’s much debate on the ability of Facebook to effect social change, but a handful of campaigns by the social networking site over the past several years have demonstrated just how powerful social media might be in prompting real-life actions.

On May 1, 2012, Facebook rolled out a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/organ-donation">new feature</a> allowing users to share their status as an organ donor on their timeline. A <a href="http://www.amjtrans.com/details/news/4911601/Social_Media_Initiative_May_Help_Increase_Organ_Donations.html">study published last month</a> in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em> shows that the experiment coincided with an incredible spike in organ donor sign-ups in the United States—13,012 on the first day of the campaign, or 21 times the daily average number of registrations. The organ donor registration rate remained higher than average for nearly two weeks.

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/DF60A2D4-FA8E-4C46-B56C-5F3F206340E2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-721" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/DF60A2D4-FA8E-4C46-B56C-5F3F206340E2-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" /></a>

Although the registration rate tailed off 12 days later, it was still two times higher than the average baseline rate by the end of the study period. By the end of two weeks, the number of new registrations reached nearly 40,000. In an <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/06/18/facebook_organ_donor_status_sheryl_sandberg_s_tweak_saved_lives_study_finds.html">article in <em>Slate</em></a>, study author and Johns Hopkins associate professor Andrew Cameron said that “Having [organ donor registration] be on Facebook makes it easier for people.” The next step will be to find ways to sustain the gains in donor sign-ups. As noted by Cameron, <a href="http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/22503-facebook-organ-donor-campaign-increases-registrations-by-2000.html">“we need to find a way to keep the conversation going”</a>.

A <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401">second study</a>, published last fall in <em>Nature</em>, showed similar results with respect to voter turnout.  The study authors worked with Facebook to randomly display to Facebook users either: 1) a message encouraging them to vote along with a link to polling places, an “I voted” button to click, up to six profile pictures of friends who had clicked the same button, and a total count of all friends who had reported voting; 2) the same message, without the photos or friend counter; or 3) no message.  By examining voting records, the authors were able to determine that users who received the first message were 0.39 percent more likely to vote than users who received no message—an effect the authors say led directly to an increase in voter turnout by 60,000.

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/Fowler_FB_VoteSocial.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-722" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/Fowler_FB_VoteSocial-300x130.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="130" /></a>

Early last year, Peter Leone, a professor of medicine with University of North Carolina, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/04/01/facebook_the_next_tool_in_fighting_stds/singleton/">began experimenting</a> with Facebook <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/04/03/how-facebook-can-predict-the-spread-of-stds/">as a tool for predicting and preventing STD</a> transmission.  While working with patients with HIV and syphilis, Leone concluded that the friend networks people have could reveal patterns about the spread of STDs. He reasoned that a person’s circle of Facebook friends often have similar risk-taking patterns, and are best way to spread information about the risk of infection—and that potentially, using Facebook to prompt people to be tested and encourage them to share information about testing could help destigmatize the process.

While debates continue about the affect of social media on events in Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and elsewhere, these early studies show that in some cases, what users see online can influence their real-world behavior.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Citizen Sensing and Crisis Informatics: Twitter and Disaster Response</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a piece published in May in <em>Smithsonian</em>, “<a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/05/the-world-according-to-twitter-in-maps/">The World According to Twitter, in Maps</a>,” Twitter use in the Western hemisphere was compared to electrification and lighting use. Studies reveal remarkably similar rates, such that a map illuminated by tweets looks very much like a satellite image of artificial light use. It seems ambitious to suggest Twitter will become as ubiquitous as light, but the findings are nonetheless illuminating. Growing global Internet saturation and increasing Twitter usage might tell us a great deal about the relationship of humans and technology, but how might <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4366/3654">Twitter analysis</a> shed light on our relationships with each other and the environment?

Since it started as a platform designed for cell phone use in 2006, Twitter has had an arguably resounding presence in the world. An estimated <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/">554 million</a> registered users send about 9,000 tweets per second and produce 58 million tweets each day on average. In people’s everyday lives and at the level of national and regional politics in places like <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/StarbirdPalen_RevolutionRetweeted.pdf">Egypt</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/07/03/the-tech-that-helped-turkish-protesters/">Turkey</a>, the microblogging service is redefining relationships, invigorating information sharing, and shifting power structures, both online and offline.

The vast number of tweets and other user-generated bits of content online has prompted new approaches to data analysis, including <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2011/09/20/data-philanthropy-is-good-for-business/">"data philanthropy,"</a> which claims to use big data to mitigate crisis and potentially avert social, financial and environmental disasters. In April, the <a href="http://skollworldforum.org/forum-2013/overview/">Skoll World Forum</a> brought together world experts on <a href="http://www.unglobalpulse.org/data-philanthropy-where-are-we-now">Big Data</a> and its application, including the  president of  non-profit technology company <a href="http://www.benetech.org/index.shtml">Benetech</a>, who explained:

<blockquote>Massive amounts of data are collected on the pollution in our cities and the changes in our climate. The more we use technology in our education and health systems, the more data we collect about how people learn and what keeps us healthy or makes us sick. These information-centric areas are built for Big Data - data that if better understood could help provide a pathway to maximize our human potential, instead of maximizing profits.</blockquote>

More than just a microblogging service on the Internet, Twitter is a platform for peer-to-peer education, a tool for real-time technology-mediated learning, and a potential gold mine for <a href="http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVIII/4-W13/ID_02.pdf">citizen sensing</a>, which engages citizens as sensors in generating geo-referenced information. Twitter’s open API feature means that tweets are downloadable as raw data. This enables Twitter <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/06/17/twitters-geography-visualized-and-explained/">mapping</a> – a form of research that turns topical tags and tweets into spaciotemporal nuggets that researchers analyze and apply toward myriads of social, political, and environmental situations, including humanitarian responses to natural disasters. Researchers at the Institute of Environment and Sustainability <a href="http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVIII/4-W13/ID_02.pdf">claim</a> ever-growing access to broadband connections and enthusiastic adoption of social media has created “the potential of up to 6 billion human sensors to monitor the state of the environment, validate global models with local knowledge, contribute to crisis situations awareness and provide information that only humans can capture.” Human-machine relationships mediated through sites like Twitter offer optimal conditions for rapid dissemination of useful information, collective thought, and social action.

<a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/Home/Crisis_Informatics.html">Crisis Informatics</a> is a research field that combines targeted information extraction and information management with coordination efforts and sensemaking processes. It emerged from collaboration among social media, emergency responders, and computer sciences. In the case of a disaster, such as a flood or tornado, crisis informatics provide knowledge about similar past disasters and response strategies. The clearinghouse of prior knowledge helps first responders predict and manage events as they unfold. Additionally, crisis informatics offers details about the extent of damage and number of fatalities, which enables more focused and efficient emergency medical responses. Mapping projects like <a href="http://gdelt.utdallas.edu/">GDELT</a> and tools like <a href="http://twitris.knoesis.org/indiarain2013/">Twitris</a> enable real-time monitoring and multi-faceted analysis across space, time, populations, networks, emotions, and sentiment. Numbers and locations are important, but data may reveal more than numbers.

Along these lines, recent analysis of more than 2 million “disaster tweets” related to the May 2013 Oklahoma tornado presents an interesting case study. As Patrick Meier of iREvolution details in his blogpost “<a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/05/29/analyzing-tweets-tornado/">Analyzing 2 Million Disaster Tweets for Oklahoma Tornado</a>,” research conducted by <a href="http://knoesis.org/researchers/hemant">Hemant Purohit</a> and colleagues at the <a href="http://qcri.com/our-research/social-innovation/social-innovation-projects">Qatar Computing Research Institute</a> further blurs the lines between computer science, social science, and humanitarian work. Purohit and his colleagues found 7% of tweets in the first 48 hours after the tornado were related to helping meet people’s immediate survival needs- donation of water, food, and clothing. Certainly, such findings reveal Twitter users’ humanitarian intentions, but they do not reveal whether the people in need actually received the supplies and services or how they fared beyond the initial 48 hours. How the individuals and communities affected by the tornado are doing today are questions for further ethnographic study that would compliment the rich statistical analysis we have and dig deeper into the relationship of Internet and society.

Learn more about Twitter analysis in a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/knoesis/icwsm-2013-tutorial-crisis-mapping-citizen-sensing-and-social-media-analytics">study</a> just released by QCRT that looks at the confluence of crisis mapping, citizen sensing, and social media through the lens of citizens’ roles in coordinating crisis response.]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">In his book <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/rewire-digital-cosmopolitans-in-the-age-of-connection/">Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection</a>, Ethan Zuckerman compares infrastructure maps, which show what’s possible, to flow maps, which show what occurs. Unsurprisingly, most of the data shown on these maps hews closely to physical borders and man-made developments such as roads. But these maps also reveal the contours of behavior: where people like to announce their presence or grab a bite to eat.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Southeast Asia</strong>
Tougher Internet filtering policies are being applied throughout Southeast Asia. Singapore’s government initiated <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/over-150-singapore-websites-and-blogs-hold-24-hour-blackout-protest-20">new rules</a> requiring online news websites to apply for individual licenses and put up a $50,000 bond. The move met with <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/over-150-singapore-websites-and-blogs-hold-24-hour-blackout-protest-20">strong response</a> from 150 websites that blacked out their homepages to protest in May, and from 2,000 demonstrators who took to streets in protest. <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/07/18/internet-censorship-is-taking-root-in-southeast-asia/?xid=rss-topstories">Vietnam</a> has been putting activists and dissidents in jail on specious charges. The country has detained forty-six bloggers and democracy activists so far this year – more than during the whole of 2012—amid erupting strikes and social unrest stirred by inflation, land-rights abuses, and corruption. <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/07/18/internet-censorship-is-taking-root-in-southeast-asia/?xid=rss-topstories">Thailand</a> has also clamped down on the Internet, strengthening Internet censorship: 20,978 URLs were blocked last year, compared to just 5,078 in 2011.

<strong>Gambia</strong>
The Gambia House of Representatives has enacted a new law banning criticism and derogatory content towards government officials on the Internet. The Information and Communication Bill 2013 puts stringent punishments in place for those who violate the law: up to 15 years in prison, a fine of up to three million Dalasi (about 100,000 US dollars), or both. The law targets any person found to be <a href="http://gainako.com/?p=1176">spreading false news or derogatory statements </a>against the government or any public officials. The bill <a href="http://en.starafrica.com/news/gambia-enacts-stringent-law-to-control-internet-use.html">seeks to</a> provide deterrent punishment of people who are engaged in  campaigns against the government both in and out of the country, according to Nana Grey-Johnson, the Gambia’s Minister of Information, Communication and Information Infrastructure. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/gambia-new-bill-stifles-online-dissent-2013-07-05">Human rights groups say</a> the new law takes the restriction of freedom of expression in the Gambia to “<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/gambia-new-bill-stifles-online-dissent-2013-07-05">a shocking new level</a>”.

<strong>Russia</strong>
Russia has been pushing <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-wikipedia-faces-ban-due-to-anti-piracy-law-director-says/482960.html#ixzz2ZDQSdybi">new legislation</a> that allows copyright holders to ask courts to <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-wikipedia-faces-ban-due-to-anti-piracy-law-director-says/482960.html#ixzz2ZDQSdybi">block access to</a> allegedly pirated content as well as hyperlinks to such content. The anti-piracy law has stirred <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/world/europe/wikipedia-shuts-site-to-protest-bill-for-firewall-in-russia.html">much controversy</a>, for it may cause Wikipedia to be blocked in the country, since Wikipedia has millions of hyperlinks to content that may or may not be authorized. If the legislation comes into force on August 1, Russian Internet users may be denied access to the whole service of Wikipedia. Wikipedia blacked out its <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/">Russian-language website</a> in protest of the proposed law.

				<title>Cloud Computing, Cloud Polluting?: An Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/06/24/cloud-computing-cloud-polluting/" target="_blank">we explored</a> the very real environmental costs of Internet services, particularly those raised by the growing trend of moving data processing and storage into "the cloud." Since then, the energy and carbon costs of the Internet and cloud computing have been a hot topic. Some IT companies have been capitalizing on the concern as well. Last month, <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2013/06/05/internet-explorer-10-is-the-most-energy-efficient-browser-on-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft began touting</a> its Internet Explorer 10 browser as the most energy efficient browser available, estimating that if every Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox user in the US switched to IE 10 for a year, the energy saved could power 10,000 households for a year. EBay has taken things a step further and is publicly disclosing its energy usage with an impressive <a href="http://dse.ebay.com/" target="_blank">online dashboard</a>.

[caption id="attachment_847" align="aligncenter" width="584"]<a href="http://dse.ebay.com/"><img class=" wp-image-847 " src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/07/Computerworld_Online_0311-4_4418-1024x629.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="358" /></a> <a href="http://dse.ebay.com/">eBay Digital Service Efficiency dashboard</a>[/caption]

In another exciting development, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are hoping to combat e-waste. Project leader John Rogers, a material scientist, recently gave details on the project, which is hoping to develop circuit boards that safely decompose when exposed to water. In his report, Rogers <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/university-aims-build-vanishing-tech-gear" target="_blank">suggests consumer "dissolving" electronics</a> are on the horizon. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1grlT7x8xk

Additionally, this week the US Department of Energy <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-12/news/sns-rt-column-kempcomputers-energy-efficiency-20130712_1_energy-efficiency-energy-consumption-servers" target="_blank">announced plans to establish minimum efficiency standards</a> for all servers and computers sold in the United States.

Perhaps the most significant development over the past month is the publication of a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n7/full/nclimate1786.html" target="_blank">study on the efficiency of data servers</a> done by Jonathan Koomey at Stanford University’s <a href="http://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/steyer-taylor-center-for-energy-policy-and-finance" target="_blank">Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance</a>. Koomey's study found that that larger companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and eBay have been working toward building sustainable data centers. However, the study also found significant waste from organizations whose servers are used by media companies, government, universities, and airlines. The study concluded that many servers could be easily and cheaply modified to use up to 80% less energy, but that a major obstacle to implementing these changes is the gap between who produces and installs the technologies and who is responsible for paying the electric bill. Koomey <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/july/servers-energy-efficiency-071913.html" target="_blank">summarized the gap by asking</a> "Who designs and builds your cable box? The cable company. Who pays the electric bill? You do. So, you end up with a cat warmer on your shelf."

Another problem the study identifies is the tendency of policymakers and environmental organizations to focus on using renewable energy instead of improving the efficiency of current data centers. Koomey suggests institutions make their centers efficient first, and then worry about switching to renewable energy sources after. This will have the added benefit of making the switch easier and more practical, since renewable energy typically produces less power than traditional sources. In other words, fix the leaky pipes before worrying about making a more efficient pump. The good news is that once these institutional issues are addressed, many data servers can be made more efficient using off-the-shelf equipment and simple management strategies.]]></content:encoded>

Since the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the American military has worked to create a system of virtually continual real-time drone surveillance of the entire country. The system is not entirely automatic, however: in 2010, Marine Corps General James E. Cartwright <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/9/drone-footage-overwhelming-analysts/print/" target="_blank">noted that at least 19 analysts</a> were needed to process video feeds from a single Predator drone. Looking through thousands of hours of collected video and audio recordings is particularly difficult. Cartwright described the work of analysis as sitting for hours watching "<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/9/drone-footage-overwhelming-analysts/print/" target="_blank">Death TV</a>," searching for single or valid targets, an activity he called "a waste of manpower [and] inefficient." 

To combat this inefficiency, researchers have experimented with building<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/military-set-develop-smart-robotic-cameras" target="_blank"> smarter cameras</a>, capable of recognizing and reporting on suspicious activity, but the development of information gathering technology continues to far outpace the ability of computers to make sense of what has been collected. As an alternative, organizations have experimented with crowd sourcing the work of analysis to online volunteers; the US Air Force even asked <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/12/19/drone-video/1770337/" target="_blank">ESPN for help</a> looking through the footage. But what happens when the work becomes play, and the people involved don't know they're working as surveillance analysts?

[caption id="attachment_931" align="alignleft" width="175"]<img class="size-full wp-image-931" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/clickwork.png" alt="" width="175" height="180" /> courtesy of NASA[/caption]

In 2000, NASA began outsourcing the tedious job of identifying craters on the moon and Mars by encouraging pubic volunteers, nicknamed "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickworkers" target="_blank">clickworkers,</a>" to identify craters in photographs posted online. What would have taken a graduate student a year to accomplish was <a href="http://yupnet.org/zittrain/archives/20#25" target="_blank">completed in only a week</a>. In 2006, the state of Texas installed webcams along the Mexico border, streamed the feeds online, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueServo" target="_blank">encouraged the public to help monitor</a> them for suspicious activities. One woman watching at 3:00 AM noticed someone signaling a pickup truck on the webcam and notified the police, which led to a high speed chase and the <a href="http://yupnet.org/zittrain/archives/20#32" target="_blank">seizure of over 400 pounds of marijuana</a>. Following the 2011 riots in London, police asked the public to look through thousands hours of CCTV footage and submit their own photos and videos <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/08/09/after-riots-london-crowdsources-cleanup-identifying-looters/" target="_blank">to identify individuals who had participated in looting</a>. Recently, a start-up in the UK began offering a service called "<a href="http://www.interneteyes.co.uk/about" target="_blank">Internet Eyes</a>," which connects the country's ubiquitous CCTVs to the Internet and offers the public rewards for identifying people committing crimes. 

Important to note is that crowdsourced surveillance efforts don't necessarily lead to results: following the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, police asked for assistance from online crowds and were <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/state-of-the-web-newtown-shooting-instant-lynch-mob/" target="_blank">led to the wrong person</a>. Following the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, a similar call for crowd assistance <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10006028/Boston-marathon-bombings-how-social-media-identified-wrong-suspects.html" target="_blank">interfered with investigations</a> and led to the <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/243028/4-innocent-people-wrongly-accused-of-being-boston-marathon-bombing-suspects" target="_blank">wrongful accusation of several innocent people</a>. 

While many of these projects use crowdsourced volunteers to handle tasks computers are not able to do, the volunteers participating are typically aware of how their work is being used. These projects attract volunteers willing to give up a little of their time to help with a project they're interested in seeing succeed or help catch someone suspected of wrongdoing. In contrast, the next generation of surveillance analysis doesn't require volunteers to know who they're working for or even that they're working.

<img class="alignright  wp-image-926" style="border: 0px;margin: 0px" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/google_streetsigns1.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="512" />In order to tell the difference between human users and computer programs designed to spam websites, computer scientist Luis von Ahn created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA" target="_blank">CAPTCHA</a>, which presents users with a challenge-response test, usually a simple mathematical operation or an image of obscured text not readable by a computer, which a user must answer or interpret to proceed. Researchers associated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg" target="_blank">Project Gutenburg</a> realized that CAPTCHA "had unwittingly created a system that was frittering away, in ten-second increments, millions of hours of a most precious resource: human brain cycles." They created a new system, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA" target="_blank">reCAPTCHA</a>, that could test for human users with images scanned from books that could not be read by a computer. Humans could decipher these scanned texts and, by entering them in as answers to the test, Project Gutenburg would be able to digitize enormous amounts of text. Since reCAPTCHA was acquired by Google in 2009, <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/faq" target="_blank">thousands of Google Books and nearly the entire archive of the <em>New York Times</em></a> have been digitized by millions of people who were not aware they were working for the project. In 2012, reCAPTCHA began <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/google-now-using-recaptcha-to-decode-street-view-addresses/" target="_blank">using photographs of house numbers taken</a> from Google's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_street_view" target="_blank">Street View</a> project. Last month, the ACLU compiled a report that found that police departments across the US were using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number_plate_recognition">automatic license plate scanners</a> to track and retain the movements of millions of Americans. The "automatic" scanners are often able to read and convert the images of license plates into computer-readable text on their own, but <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/22998473/Vehicle-License-Plate-Recognition-System">reCAPTCHA has also been used to digitize</a> the more difficult images.

Luis von Ahn noticed how many hours people spent playing Windows Solitaire and devised an online game called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP_game" target="_blank">ESP</a>" in which two players would be randomly shown a pair of images and asked to guess the word that best described the pair. When both players made the same guess, they would win points. Playing the game <a href="http://yupnet.org/zittrain/archives/20#26" target="_blank">also contributed to building a database</a> of labels for graphical search engines. Without even knowing it, millions of people playing an online game were helping to build surveillance databases and were working for free helping improve the ability for computers to search images.

Big gaming companies and other groups are also taking note of the possibilities for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computation" target="_blank">human computation</a>" embedded in games. After researchers at the University of Washington led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Baker_(biochemist)">David Baker</a> successfully <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/09/19/foldit-gamers-solve-aids-puzzle-that-baffled-scientists-for-decade/">solved the puzzle of an AIDS-causing virus</a> that had stumped scientists for 15 years in only ten days using an online game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldit">Foldit</a> in 2012, the gamification of tedious labor has been a popular concept. In early 2013, the <a href="http://internet-response-league.com/" target="_blank">Internet Response League</a> launched a plugin that allows <a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/05/29/gamers-to-the-rescue/" target="_blank">online gamers to help support disaster response</a> operations. In <em>Word of Warcraft</em>, for example, gamers can receive disaster alerts and momentarily interrupt their play to tag images of disaster areas and rank them according to their severity. For the past four years, Ubisoft has been developing a new kind of game called <em>Watch Dogs</em>, set to be released in December 2013. As part of its marketing campaign for <em>Watch Dogs</em>, Ubisoft launched a website called <a href="http://wearedata.watchdogs.com/" target="_blank">WeareData</a> that <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Watch-Dogs-WeareData-Site-Shows-Surveillance-In-Action-364134.shtml" target="_blank">gathers and graphs real-world city data</a> from London, Berlin, and Paris. <a href="http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/23723/ubisoft-launch-watch-dogs-wearedata-site-provides-real-world-city-data" target="_blank">Real-time data</a>, including social network updates, the locations of Wi-Fi hotspots, and feeds from CCTV cameras, is streamed onto the site's 3D city maps. The actual game will also include these streams and is built to connect with players' Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media accounts to provide seamless integration of these networks with game play.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://wearedata.watchdogs.com/"><img class=" wp-image-929 aligncenter" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/wearedata.jpg" alt="" width="934" height="596" /></a></p>
Ubisoft's marketing website and eventual game highlights our visibility online (something we're already acutely aware of since the revelation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)" target="_blank">PRISM</a> and other government data surveillance programs), but also suggests an alternative future of surveillance and analysis than the kind popularized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four)">George Orwell's invention of Big Brother</a>. It may not be long before someone like Luis von Ahn builds systems that rely upon the unwitting assistance of crowds to analyze CCTV feeds looking for criminals or someone like David Baker makes decrypting communications and files a fun game. Future players tagging photos in connected games like <em>Watch Dogs</em> might be helping to <a href="https://riot2011.vpd.ca/" target="_blank">identify participants in riots</a> while also collecting data on other players. People posting comments online, taking and tagging pictures for social networks, or simply drawing unlock patterns on their smartphone screens may help sort through the glut of gathered information. The surveillance analysts of the future may not be people wearing clipped on name badges watching hours of Death TV at the Pentagon. The work of watching and reporting may be done by all of us as we go about the everyday routines of digital life or escape for a while with a fun new game.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I find that this relates to Foucault's Discipline and Punish (1975). In the book he speaks to a micro-physics of the modern-soul, where the classical laws of Newtonian physics are found to no longer apply to the micro. The point here is that power itself becomes decentralized - it is not just the sovereign who is disciplining and punishing the body. Instead according to a micro-physics power is distributed amongst all human beings, it is relational, and it is acted out in the dividing up of our days into schedules. Likewise, when applying the micro-physics of power to the panopticon we arrive at the surveillance society on the one hand, as you point out, but perhaps more-so on the other hand we arrive at the inculcation of the subject. This is how Foucault sees the soul being formed. It is the internalization of the acts of punishment on one's own body, the internalization of authority, that we are witnessing here. Therefore, technological surveillance and crowd-sourcing creates the space for getting at the interior. The evaluation is both the punishment and the reward - people carry out their own torture/punishment of themselves. This constant surveillance is perhaps the most efficient form of normalizing behavior in history. But, the point is not that technology is scary, or that we are being watched by Big Brother, rather it is that on the one hand we have total micro division of self through self-discipline; yet on the other we have become masters of ourselves to see power in the everyday. Thus, perhaps there is a means for agency here. Thanks Rex!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>United Kingdom</strong>
News reports and online discussions on freedom of expression have been dominated this week by Prime Minister David Cameron’s proposals to require ISP-level anti-pornography filters. Cameron’s motivations for the proposal <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/family-filters-wont-block-soft-porn-david-cameron-retreats-in-war-on-internet-porn-admitting-there-will-be-problems-down-the-line-8726991.html">have been questioned</a>, especially after ISPs disclosed that the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/family-filters-wont-block-soft-porn-david-cameron-retreats-in-war-on-internet-porn-admitting-there-will-be-problems-down-the-line-8726991.html">filter settings include blocks for many other</a> kinds of online content such as social networking, gambling, file sharing, or sites concerned with drugs, alcohol and tobacco. The UK government’s <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/huawei-privacy-concerns-raised-on-porn-filter-praised-by-david-cameron-7000018662/">reliance on the Chinese telecom firm Huawei</a> to maintain the list of blocked  sites and the decision to turn the filter on by default, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/uk/uk-to-automatically-filter-adult-internet-content-7000018403/">requiring users to opt-out</a> of filtered access, has prompted strong responses from freedom of expression and privacy advocates. Adding to the controversy, hackers posted pornographic images on the website of Claire Perry, one of the architects of the ISP-level filters. Perry’s response generated more controversy when <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/mp-behind-uk-internet-porn-filter-hacked-accuses-blogger-who-reported-it-7000018542/">she accused the blogger</a> who reported the hack as being responsible for the content; critics argue her responses <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/07/25/architect-of-uk-porn-filter-scheme-sued-after-hack-spat/">demonstrate a poor understanding</a> of digital technologies.

<strong>Russia</strong>
It’s been a controversial week for the Russian Internet. The country’s recent waves of violence against members of the LGBTQ community have been <a href="http://www.towleroad.com/2013/07/watch-russian-homophobes-are-using-social-media-to-lure-entrap-and-torture-gay-teens-video.html">facilitated by social networks</a>, which vigilantes use to identify and physically locate victims, and by the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/horrific-russia-gay-bullying-video-goes-viral-2013-7">ability to share bullying videos</a> online. The U.S. has also identified several young <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/albert-gonzalez-conspirators/">Russians behind top U.S. cyber thefts</a> in the last seven years, leading to arrests and extraditions. Finally, the head of the Russian State Duma’s Committee for Family, Women, and Children has proposed modifications to Russia’s existing content rules to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/29/russia_to_ban_swearing_on_social_networks_good_luck/">block bad language from social networks, websites, and forums</a>. Earlier this year, Russia banned swearing from its media outlets and prohibited countries from making products featuring swear words. Also, today <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57595920/co-founder-of-russias-biggest-search-engine-dies/">Ilya Segalovich</a>, the co-founder of Russia's largest search engine Yandex, has died.

<strong>Australia</strong>
Shortly after the UK announced it would be requiring ISPs to filter adult content, the Australian Christian Lobby announced it would be <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/au/uk-internet-filtering-plan-re-energises-australian-censorship-crusade-7000018466/">renewing its campaigns to block porn</a> in Australia. In 2008 Australia attempted to pass similar porn-blocking legislation, but lack of popular support killed the proposed plan when the Coalition government refused to vote on the matter. At the same time, Australia’s Parliamentary Inquiry into the higher prices charged by IT companies selling hardware, software, and digital downloads in Australia recommended that the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/29/australia_threatens_adobe_apple_with_geoblocking_ban/">Australian government educate consumers in circumventing</a> the geolocation tools used by IT companies to determine where buyers are located. The Inquiry also required testimony from representatives of Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft as to the reasons for the higher prices, but found these companies could not satisfactorily explain the reason for increasing product prices when sold to people in Australia.

<strong>United States</strong>
This week, an anonymous <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57595202-38/feds-put-heat-on-web-firms-for-master-encryption-keys/">web developer claimed</a> that the U.S. government is requiring companies to turn over encryption keys. The U.S. government has so far denied the claims and some companies, like Microsoft and Google, have declined to say whether the government has made any such requests, but indicate they will not comply if asked for server-to-server email encryption keys. Also, an Internet monitoring company released a study which found that <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9240945/Google_bigger_than_Facebook_Netflix_and_Instagram_combined?source=rss_internet&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+computerworld%2Fs%2Ffeed%2Ftopic%2F167+%28Computerworld+Internet+News%29&amp;utm_content=Netvibes">Google is responsible for 25%</a> of all Internet traffic in North America, which is more than Facebook, Netflix, and Instagram combined. This is up from 6% of Internet traffic in 2010. Finally, a Texas man was charged this week for creating an operating a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/23/bitcoin_ponzi_scheme/">Bitcoin Ponzi scheme</a> worth approximately $65 million at today’s exchange rate. The scam involved using money from new investors to make "interest" payments to earlier ones and to cover withdrawals.

I understand that Search Engine level filters do not exclude social networking sites etc. But I am sure if the filter is done properly, it will not exclude those sites or at least have a built in list of "exempt" sites. I do however also feel that making the ISP Level filters auto-enabled is a bit much, rather have the individuals who would have such content filtered, contact the ISP to have it enabled.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>
Raif Badawi, founder of the website Free Saudi Liberals, faces seven years in jail and 600 lashes for “<a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/07/29/saudi-website-founder-to-be-imprisoned-lashed/">'setting up a website that undermines general security’ and ridiculing Islamic religious figures</a>.” The website is a public discussion forum that authorities have blocked for years; the judge in this case ordered it shut down. The government arrested Badawi in June 2012 for <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2013/07/30/saudi-website-editor-gets-seven-years-in-prison-and-600-lashes-for-liberal-forum/">cybercrime and failing to obey his father</a>, and sentenced him more than one year later, in July 2013. Badawi initially faced charges of apostasy, which would have condemned him to death.

<strong>Russia</strong>
Russian blogger Anton Ilyushchenko discovered that a local nightclub had posted pictures on its website of seemingly intoxicated patrons “<a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/08/01/6-years-in-a-russian-prison-for-sharing-porn/">engaged in what appeared to be amateur striptease contests and public sex acts</a>.” The Omsk resident posted them on his blog and criticized the nightclub. The post went viral and police began investigating him for distributing pornographic material, charges that carry a punishment of two to six years in prison. Some people said Ilyushchenko posted the pictures to generate traffic for his blog. Most who have spoken online about the case criticize the police for caring more about the image of the city and for failing to go after the nightclub where the photos originated.

<strong>Vietnam</strong>
Vietnam’s prime minister <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/362583/outcry-as-vietnam-decree-restricts-social-media-posts">approved</a> a decree that states blogs and social media sites can only contain personal information. “Personal electronic sites are only allowed to put news owned by that person, and are not allowed to 'quote', 'gather' or summarize information from press organizations or government websites” said Hoang Vinh Bao, director of the Broadcasting and Electronic Information Department at the Ministry of Information and Communications, to local media. The decree also forbids foreign Internet service providers from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/vietnam/10215935/Vietnam-to-ban-sharing-of-news-stories-on-social-media.html">sharing</a> “information that is against Vietnam.” Facebook users in Vietnam criticized the law, asking if sharing a link was now a punishable offense and lamenting that the government showed no signs of understanding the value of an open society. Digital rights organizations have criticized the decree’s <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/08/01/vietnam-adopts-regulations-to-ban-internet-users-from-sharing-news-reports-online/">vague language</a>. The law is set to take effect on September 1, but it is unclear how the government will enforce the rule.

The Wikimedia Foundation is <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/08/01/in-response-to-nsas-xkeyscore-wikimedia-to-enable-https-by-default-starting-with-logged-in-users-on-august-21/">accelerating plans</a> to enable native HTTPS for all its projects after leaked information indicated that the NSA’s XKeyscore program “specifically targeted” the site. The Chinese anti-censorship organization Greatfire <a href="https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2013/jun/wikimedia-foundation-says-it-doesnt-hold-chinese-readers-any-less-regard-we-disagree">took Wikipedia to task</a> in June for dragging its feet on native HTTPS. China completely blocks HTTPS versions of Wikimedia’s projects, and Greatfire alleges that Wikipedia’s move could force the Chinese government to loosen its censorship of the site. In addition to Internet filtering and blocking, China is adding another tactic to its censorship arsenal: fact-checking. The nonprofit Beijing Internet Association is teaming up with the state-run Beijing Internet Information Office to launch a website that corrects falsehoods on the Internet. One visiting scholar at Columbia University said the site's utility <a href="http://qz.com/111134/not-content-with-censorship-chinese-authorities-unveil-a-rumor-debunking-website/">may be limited</a> if people don’t trust the government. Amidst the government’s overarching censorship, one area will remain free. The University of Macau will become the first university on mainland China to obtain <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/08/02/uncensored-internet-macau-universitys-new-campus.html">access to an uncensored Internet</a> when it moves to its new facility on Guangdong’s Hengqin Island in January.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This is a guest post.</em>

<p style="text-align: left" align="center">On June 9, Edward Snowden, an American former contractor for the NSA, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323495604578535653583992418.html">revealed himself</a> as the whistleblower in one of the biggest surveillance scandals in US intelligence history.</p>
Snowden’s flight to Hong Kong in late May stirred a wide and active response on the Chinese Internet. Snowden’s name was one of the top-ranked topics on China’s Twitter-like microblogging website Sina Weibo in June. Vexed by <a href="https://opennet.net/research/profiles/china-including-hong-kong">the country’s</a> long-standing and prevalent surveillance system, many Chinese Internet users have hailed Snowden as a hero.

“He is brave. He is a real fighter for human rights. Now he is in China, we should protect him,” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/11/world/asia/snowden-sina-weibo-support">wrote Xiaodong Wang</a>, an Internet user based in Beijing.  Another user wrote, “it doesn’t matter whether you can call Snowden a hero. What’s worth of praise about him is he chose to break the rules rather than to be one of ‘the Great Silent Majority.’ Few people have his courage.”

Several prominent Weibo users with millions of followers, known as “Big Vs” for the large letter V (signaling a verified user) next to their account names, also expressed their appreciation of Snowden’s actions. Lvqiu Luwei, a well-known journalist who has 2.7 million followers on Weibo, wrote:

<blockquote>To the public, Snowden is a hero. But if he leaked the information to other governments or did this simply for money, people would think of him as a spy. I asked a guest in the programs I recorded yesterday, ‘will there be a Snowden in China?’ And the guest responded with a quick answer, ‘there won’t be a Snowden-like person in China. If there were, the person will never get out of the country.</blockquote>

Another popular user with the nickname “Pretending to be in New York” (<a href="http://www.weibo.com/sudd">@假装在纽约</a>) posted the following comment on June 25, which gained momentum when circulated on the social media. The humorous tweet makes fun of the Snowden’s story while criticizing the dire human rights conditions and heavy-handed Internet control in China:

<blockquote>If Snowden were a Chinese citizen, 1) Hong Kong would agree to hand him over to the Chinese government; 2) the US would hail him as hero and then try to rescue him immediately; 3) his name would become a ‘sensitive word’ on the social media in China and all discussions related would be banned; 4) Over a thrilling struggle, he would finally board the airplane to New York; 5) people would acclaim the escape on the social media in China; 6) New York University would invite him to be a visiting scholar (referencing to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Guangcheng">Chen Guangcheng</a> incident); 7) the state-run Global Times would post articles criticizing Snowden, and it would become the target of Chinese netizen’s besiege. 8) American talk shows making fun of the story would be translated into Chinese.</blockquote>

Still, many Chinese were disappointed at the seeming hypocrisy of the US government, which appears to be engaging in activities more typically associated with the Chinese government. Though Hong Kong&mdash;which has a long tradition of free speech&mdash;operates separately from Mainland China, it is under the political influence of a nation known for its restrictions on free political expression.

To some in China, the news badly undermined the US government’s criticism of China over cyberespionage. “It looks like Obama has been assimilated by a certain political party (Communist Party of China),” Sina Weibo user Leigh Chiang <a href="http://weibo.com/1900223465/zALCFoic2">wrote</a> in a sentiment shared widely across the site.

Somewhere between 300 and 900 Hong Kong residents <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/world/asia/demonstrators-march-for-snowden-in-hong-kong.html">marched</a> in support of Snowden, despite the ambiguous attitudes from the SAR (Special Administrative Region) government. <span style="text-align: center"> </span>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/05/chinas-reactions-to-the-snowden-story/attachment/1/" rel="attachment wp-att-902"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/1-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
Snowden’s announcement came as China began an official three-day holiday for the Dragon Boat Festival. Still, it managed to catch the eyes of the country’s social media users.

The leak broke just ahead of the much anticipated “laid-back” Sunnylands Summit between Obama and China’s Premier Xi Jinping – where, among other issues, cyber-security was prominent on the agenda. There’s no lack of irony in the leak. The US government has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/16/barack-obama-criticises-internet-censorship-china">criticizing the Chinese government</a> for Internet filtering, and a more recent accusation made by the Obama administration is that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/world/asia/china-criticizes-pentagon-report-on-cyberattacks.html?_r=0">China has been hacking</a> into American computers. Now it turns out one of the biggest threats to the pursuit of individual freedom and privacy in the US may be the unbridled power of the government, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/opinion/nocera-this-isnt-how-to-stop-hackers.html?_r=0">according to a Chinese expert on American affairs</a>. The country that seems to benefit most from Snowden’s revelations is China.

Bloomberg News reported that Lee Kai-Fu, the founding president of Google China, stated that Snowden’s revelation <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-13/hong-kong-groups-plan-protest-to-support-edward-snowden.html">“seriously discredits”</a> US claims about human rights and privacy. Lee, who has 49.3 million followers, is a Big V, also known as verified user on Sina Weibo. He wrote in a microblog post on June 11 that he admires Snowden’s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-13/hong-kong-groups-plan-protest-to-support-edward-snowden.html">“principles and values.”</a>

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/05/chinas-reactions-to-the-snowden-story/attachment/2/" rel="attachment wp-att-903"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-903" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/2-173x300.png" alt="" width="173" height="300" /></a>

Lee Kai-Fu’s criticism of the US government has invoked some criticism on social media, among which some netizens ridiculed him as turning his political stand to align with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party">“Fifty Cent Party,”</a> the people hired by the Chinese government to post comments favorable to the party to sway public opinions.

While Hong Kong-based media outlets are featuring Snowden in top headlines, the mainland Chinese media are not treating this like a big deal. Beijing has remained quite low-key towards the issue, with major news portals’ headlines saturated by the Obama-Xi meetings.

<em>The Global Times</em>, the tabloid-like subsidiary of <em>The People’s Daily, </em>which is the major state-run media outlet in China, ran an article about “the latest online spy game,” accompanied by a caricature cartoon of the NSA emblem, turning the bald eagle into a spy. The article said Snowden could offer intelligence that would help China update its understanding of cyberspace and improve its position in negotiations with Washington.

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/05/chinas-reactions-to-the-snowden-story/attachment/3/" rel="attachment wp-att-904"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-904" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/3-300x161.png" alt="" width="300" height="161" /></a>

China’s largest state-run news agency, Xinhua, didn’t mention Snowden in the <a href="https://admin.theatlanticwire.com/static/img/upload/2013/06/10/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-10%20at%2010.12.15%20AM.png">top 10 stories</a> on its website’s front page. Xinhua has not published any specific reports on Snowden, though there is one <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2013-06/10/c_132445529.htm">video report</a> on the NSA as a “spy agency.” It’s hard to tell whether the lack of reporting is a conscious decision to avoid stirring up a conversation that might come back to China again.

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/05/chinas-reactions-to-the-snowden-story/attachment/4/" rel="attachment wp-att-905"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-905" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/4-300x163.png" alt="" width="300" height="163" /></a>

When the country’s media outlets constrained the urge to make the Snowden story headlines, news broke on June 22 that NSA targeted China’s top universities in extensive hacking attacks. Suddenly, reports began to emerge from repressed writers and editors; comments and discussions on the news overwhelmed social media in China.

“The U.S. Has Attacked Chinese Networks for 15 Years,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/opinion/nocera-this-isnt-how-to-stop-hackers.html">said a headline in The Yangtze Daily</a>. “Snowden Leaks Information About Prism to Reveal the Hypocrisy of the U.S. Government,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/opinion/nocera-this-isnt-how-to-stop-hackers.html">added The Wuhan Evening News</a>.

Tsinghua University was among the targets of NSA’s cyber-snooping activities, with at least <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324577904578562483284884530.html">63 computers and servers</a> attacked during a single day in January, according to information leaked by Snowden. The university is home to one of the mainland’s six major backbone networks - the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) – a hub from which Internet data from millions of Chinese citizens could be mined.

A spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t have an immediate comment on Mr. Snowden’s comments. Professor Xu Ke, deputy director of the Institute of Computer Networks at Tsinghua University, <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1266892/exclusive-nsa-targeted-chinas-tsinghua-university-extensive-hacking?page=all">has previously said</a> that most data passing through network backbones was not encrypted and that most attacks on such networks were carried out by governments, as individual hackers would face ‘colossal’ amounts of information that would be extremely difficult to handle.

While the mainstream media in China remained silent towards the PRISM scandal, observers have noticed the subtle changes of its contents. In April 2013, China <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/13/chinese-media-can-quote-foreign-press-on-snowden-saga/">tightened</a> its media’s quotations of information from foreign press, aiming to exert stronger control over domestic media outlets. Ironically, Chinese media <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/13/chinese-media-can-quote-foreign-press-on-snowden-saga/">began to include more quotes</a> from foreign press as the Snowden story was revealed.

				<title>The Pursuit of Open Government</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Countries in the Middle East and North Africa historically held statistical data about their populations close. But in recent years, Tunisia, Yemen, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Djibouti, and Jordan have joined regional open data pioneers Palestine and Iraq in <a href="http://menablog.worldbank.org/silent-data-revolution-arab-world">releasing</a> detailed data sets to the public or directly to organizations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While this offers promise to researchers, students, journalists, and citizens who seek detailed information about life in the region, open government involves more than posting data online. Countries around the world are talking about open government, and people are creating useful tools and uncovering important stories with open data. But legislative obstacles, fear, and gaps in access to information communication technology can reduce or even detract from the benefits of open government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The United States and United Kingdom launched open data portals between 2009 and 2010, <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/open-data-study">spearheading</a> an open government data movement. <a href="https://opendata.go.ke/vision">Kenya</a> launched a portal in 2011, and <a href="http://www.futuregov.asia/articles/2013/jul/15/new-government-portal-launched-sri-lanka/">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2013/2013-06-18.asp">Canada</a> unveiled updated versions of their portals this June.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More than 50 countries have <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-government-declaration">joined</a> an Open Government Declaration. This June the G8 countries passed an <a href="http://opensource.com/government/13/7/open-data-charter-g8">Open Data Charter</a> pledging to develop and implement open data policies. Experts praised this initial step but <a href="http://policyreview.info/articles/news/hard-times-open-data/172">cautioned</a> that cumbersome licensing or inability to enforce policies, among other concerns, could hinder the charter’s effectiveness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Open Knowledge Foundation compiled a <a href="http://census.okfn.org/country/">census</a> that evaluates data from 60 countries (at the time of writing) on seven conditions: existence online, open licensing, public availability, machine readability, digital availability, recency, and bulk availability. The census deems less than one-quarter of datasets truly "open."</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Knight Foundation recently <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/open-government-projects-receive-more-32-million-w/">awarded</a> $3.2 million in grants to develop online tools that facilitate citizen-government information sharing. The city of Oakland, California <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/community-democracy-project-to-open-entire-city-budget">developed</a> a process to involve citizens in allocating the city’s budget; this includes a <a href="http://openbudgetoakland.org/">website</a> with data and visualizations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The buzzwords <em>transparency</em> and <em>accountability</em> often accompany pronouncements about open government data. But the concepts do not always operate hand-in-hand. Availability of mass-transit data <a href="http://govfresh.com/2013/04/visualize-this-a-weeks-worth-of-nyc-subway-entries-and-exits/">yields</a> an animation of how people in New York use the subway. Availability of procurement data <a href="http://znasichdani.sk/l?l=en">enables</a> an interactive database to map connections between people, companies, and government contracts in Slovakia. Both provide useful insights, but one offers greater utility to citizens who want to keep their government honest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Governments continue to speak of the benefits of open data, but too often the conversation focuses on “opening up uncontroversial data sets and the method of distributing these data sets” instead of letting journalists and citizens freely access public data and use it to question public servants, <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/07/open-government-whistleblowers/">writes</a> Index on Censorship’s Mike Harris. He cites excessive classification of documents in the United States, broad exemptions in Rwanda’s freedom of information law, and a threatening environment for journalists in Azerbaijan as examples of governments paying lip service to open data.</p>
Even if governments provide access to their data and incorporate data analysis into their decision-making, the digital divide reminds users to consider the representativeness of that data. If the Centers for Disease Control <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/07/big-data-not-big-enough-how-digital-divide-leaves-people-out">uses</a> Google searches to monitor flu trends, what happens to communities that do not have Internet access or to people who do not own a computer?

Democracy draws strength from the participation of an informed citizenry, and the Internet offers tools to realize new levels of civic engagement. But as long as governments allow data to remain hidden or people who pursue that data to be intimidated, openness remains an aspiration.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>China</strong>
After multiple employees of Hong Kong-based company Phoenix Satellite Television <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-arm-major-chinese-media-company-facing-suit-19875595">accused</a> the company's former Washington, DC bureau chief of sexual harassment last week, nearly all mention of the scandal was scrubbed from the Chinese Internet.  <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/08/07/sexual_assault_scandal_vanishes_from_chinese_internet"><em>Foreign Policy</em> reports</a> that videos about the story have been blocked, while articles on the case have been taken down from China's state-run news agency.  FP notes that the current CEO of Phoenix's US subsidiary is the son of China's former Vice Premier.

<strong>Pakistan</strong>
Pakistan's Minister of State for Information Technology said last week that the country is working to develop software that will block <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/586750/youtube-ban-over-2700-such-websites-also-blocked-says-it-minister/">"objectionable content"</a> worldwide.  Once all such content is blocked, the minister stated, the country could theoretically lift its ban on YouTube.  The video-sharing site has been blocked in Pakistan since <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/08/banistan-why-is-youtube-still-blocked-in-pakistan.html">September 2012</a>.

<strong>Zimbabwe</strong>
Zimbabwe held presidential elections on July 31; the resulting re-election of President Robert Mugabe is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/robert-mugabe-election-win-zimbabwe">hotly contested</a>.  During and after the elections, DDoS attacks took down <a href="http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/zimbabwe-election-cyber-attacks-123938">several human rights and media websites</a>.  In addition, Kubatana.net, which publishes human rights and civic information online and via email and SMS, was blocked from sending bulk text messages by an alleged government order.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Cuba</strong>
Earlier this year, Cuba's government-owned telecommunications firm <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/07/16/rationing-the-digital/">activated two undersea fiber optic cables and announced it would open 100 new public Internet cafés</a>.  Cuban citizens, heretofore largely cut off from the global Internet, are now beginning to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/05/world/americas/cuba-online-access/index.html?hpt=wo_c2">go online</a>.  Access is not cheap&mdash;at $4.50 per hour, or roughly the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/world/americas/salons-or-not-cyberspace-is-still-a-distant-place-for-most-cubans.html?pagewanted=all">average weekly salary</a> for a state employee, using one of the cafés is still out of reach for many Cubans&mdash;and those who want to go online must first sign a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/05/world/americas/cuba-online-access/index.html?hpt=wo_c2">statement</a> swearing they will not do anything that might harm Cuba's "economy, sovereignty or national security."

<strong>Thailand</strong>
The government of Thailand has <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/08/19/thailand-wants-to-monitor-conversations-on-line-app/">announced its intentions</a> to monitor conversations on the Line messaging app, claiming that surveillance is necessary to "safeguard order, security and morality of Thailand."  The national police's Technology Crime Suppression Division has <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2013/08/14/thai-police-seeks-help-from-line-app/">asked the Japan-based company</a> to give access to Thai authorities.

<strong>United Kingdom</strong>
The partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has been reporting on the NSA's surveillance programs for the <em>Guardian</em>, was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/glenn-greenwald-guardian-partner-detained-heathrow">detained</a> at Heathrow airport yesterday under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.  David Miranda had been in Berlin to meet with a filmmaker who has been working with Greenwald on the Snowden files; he was returning to his home in Rio de Janeiro when he was stopped and questioned for nine hours&mdash;the maximum allowed by the law.  His laptop, phone, and other electronics were confiscated.  Greenwald has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/world/europe/britain-detains-partner-of-reporter-tied-to-leaks.html">publicly stated</a> that the detention was an "abuse of the law" intended to intimidate reporters writing about the NSA; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/amnesty-condemns-heathrow-detention">Amnesty International</a> has spoken out against the detention.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How do Internet users use Facebook to gather news and information? It varies widely depending on the country.

After Northwestern University published an <a href="http://menamediasurvey.northwestern.edu/">eight-nation study</a> surveying media use in the Middle East, publications grabbed hold of the headline that Facebook is the <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/study-facebook-third-most-popular-news-source-in-arab-world/s2/a553306/">third most popular site for news</a> in the Middle East. That's not wrong, but the story is more nuanced than that. News gathering habits vary widely in different countries in the region and around the world.

For instance, although Facebook was mentioned as a top three media outlet by 52% of survey respondents in Tunisia, the social network didn't see steady levels of popularity across the region. In many of the countries surveyed, Facebook didn't rank in the top three outlets at all.

While Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and Facebook were the most popular outlets on average in the region overall, below is a breakdown of what usage of each outlet looked like broken down by individual country.

[caption id="attachment_950" align="aligncenter" width="646"]<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/top3-northwestern.png"><img src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/top3-northwestern.png" alt="Top news outlets by country" title="top3-northwestern" width="646" height="382" class="size-full wp-image-950" /></a> Top news outlets by country, according to Northwestern study. Image credit: <a href="http://menamediasurvey.northwestern.edu/">Media Use in the Middle East</a>[/caption]

The situation is equally complex for how citizens in the surveyed region use media sources more generally. In each country, television remained the most dominant source for information on news and current events by far&mdash;an average of 83% of respondents across the region identified TV as a top news source. When respondents were asked if they used the Internet to gather this type of information, the answers were much more scattered, with a low of 22% of respondents using the Internet for news in Egypt versus a high of 85% in Bahrain. In a different survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in the United States, <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Trend-Data-(Adults)/Online-Activites-Total.aspx">78% of respondents</a> said they use the Internet to get news.

[imchart page="charts/2013-08-15/multibar2.html"]

Do news consumers seek out international coverage? That varies widely across different nations, too. Survey takers in Egypt were least likely to follow international news, with just 17% of respondents listing international news as a news topic they follow closely or very closely. However, nearby Saudi Arabia took the regional lead in terms of international news consumption, with 63% of respondents following international news closely or very closely.

Despite various communities lamenting the loss of international news media coverage in American news outlets, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Communities-and-Local-News.aspx">56% of US-based news consumers surveyed by Pew still said they closely follow international news most of the time</a>. In both the US and the Middle East, survey takers responded that they follow local and national news more frequently than international news.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>China</strong>
Chinese mobile app WeChat has a growing international presence, making it the fifth most popular mobile app worldwide.  Within the country, WeChat is heavily monitored, and users are blocked from sending messages containing prohibited keywords.  <em>TeaLeafNation</em> <a href="http://www.tealeafnation.com/2013/08/chinas-wildly-popular-chat-app-inhabits-two-parallel-universes/">reports</a> that TenCent, which owns WeChat, is now offering two versions of the app: a censored version for Chinese users, and an uncensored version for international use.  The problem: the lines between the two are unclear, as shown by the suspension last week of a US-based WeChat account belonging to ChinaGate, a Chinese-language web portal hosted outside of China.

<strong>Finland</strong>
The Finnish Supreme Administrative Court <a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2013/08/26/finnish_court_censoring_a_website_that_criticized_censorship_is_legal">ruled today</a> that the country's National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) was within its rights when it added an anti-censorship website to its secret list of blocked sites.  The blocking took place under a 2006 law that enabled the NBI to maintain a secret blocklist of sites that distribute child pornography.  The website lapsiporno.info ("childporn.info") has been monitoring the bureau's activities, criticizing the secrecy behind the blocklist and compiling a list of known blocked sites.  When lapsiporno.info was blocked, operator Matt Nikki sued the NBI.  The court ruled that even though Nikki's site did not host any child porn, by listing blocked sites it was enabling users to find such sites, and therefore, the NBI's blocking of lapsiporno.info was legal.

<strong>United States</strong>
Mark Zuckerberg <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/690/Technology-Leaders-Launch-Partnership-to-Make-Internet-Access-Available-to-All">announced</a> last week that Facebook, along with a handful of tech companies, is launching an effort to bring Internet access to everyone on Earth.  Zuckerberg <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/technology/facebook-leads-an-effort-to-lower-barriers-to-internet-access.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&hp">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em> that the project&mdash;<a href="http://internet.org/">Internet.org</a>&mdash;is more about doing "something good for the world" than for profit, but many commentators disagree.  The <em>New Yorker's</em> Matt Buchanan notes that the project <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/08/zuckerberg-and-internetorg-plan-to-give-the-internet-to-all.html">offers little</a> in the way of infrastructure building, which is one of the biggest obstacles to Internet access.  And <em>The Atlantic's</em> Alexis Madrigal <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/what-internetorgs-stirring-video-cut-from-the-kennedy-speech-it-quotes/278896/">points out</a> that the project heavily recuts a John F. Kennedy speech, stripping the original Cold War context and perhaps, Madrigal argues, changing the meaning entirely. 

<strong>United States</strong>
The newest piece of the NSA surveillance scandal: LOVEINT.  Last week the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/">reported</a> that several NSA officers have used their power to spy on their romantic partners.  Approximately ten cases of this type of abuse of NSA power have emerged over the past decade, and according to NSA officials, in each case, the employee responsible was punished and/or terminated. The LOVEINT discovery comes amidst the NSA's <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/nsa-admits-rare-willful-surveillance-violations-some-employees-spied-love-interests-1398055">admission</a> last week that in the past year alone, the agency violated privacy regulations nearly 3000 times.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this week's <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/26/imweekly-august-26-2013/">#IMWeekly news roundup</a>, we reported that at least ten NSA officers have used the agency's surveillance power to spy on their romantic partners over the past decade&mdash;a practice deemed "LOVEINT" by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, which <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/">broke the story</a>.

Yesterday, NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/26/215770253/id-tap-that-and-other-nsa-pick-up-lines-are-all-the-rage">reported</a> that Twitter users have taken the story and run with it, posting satirical pick-up lines and love poems under the hashtags <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nsapickuplines&mode=realtime">#NSAPickupLines</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nsalovepoems&mode=realtime&src=typd">#NSALovePoems</a>.

Some of the most amusing tweets we've seen so far:

The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic">Nakhchivan</a>, an Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan, has ordered Internet cafes throughout the area to <a href="http://www.ifex.org/azerbaijan/2013/08/30/internet_cafe/">shut down</a>.  Human rights activists speculate that the order may be part of an attempt to curb online dissent in advance of Azerbaijan's October 9 presidential elections.  Bloggers and journalists throughout the country who are critical of the government have faced <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/08/2013826114929165535.html">arrests, hacking, and blackmail attempts</a> over the past year as part of a broad crackdown on online freedom of expression.

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/07/23/imweekly-july-22-2013/">Recently passed legislation</a> in Gambia amending the Information and Communication Act to include a prohibition against the <a href="http://www.ifex.org/the_gambia/2013/07/05/online_threat/">spread of false news</a> and the <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201308160680.html'>criticism and/or caricature of government officials</a> appears to be targeted at online activists.  Those found guilty under the law face <a href="http://www.freemedia.at/home/singleview/article/amendments-to-gambias-communication-law-threaten-press-freedom.html">jail terms</a> of up to 15 years.  Speaking about the new legislation, Gambia's head of Civil Service and Minister of Presidential Affairs <a href="http://www.ifex.org/the_gambia/2013/08/19/gambia_alert_government/">warned</a>, "If you cannot say anything good about the country, then you should keep quiet."

<strong>Syria</strong>
As the conflict in Syria continues, the country's Internet connectivity is experiencing a number of changes.  Internet access in Aleppo, the country's largest city, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/30/syrias-largest-city-just-dropped-off-the-internet/">went completely dark</a> on August 29.  Renesys <a href="http://www.renesys.com/2013/08/whats-next-for-syrias-internet/">explored the country's international service providers</a> and noted that Aleppo appears to be served almost exclusively by Turk Telecom via a land-based cable link, while the rest of the country is served by a small handful of other providers via three undersea cables.  

<strong>United States</strong>
Last week we <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/26/imweekly-august-26-2013/">reported</a> on Internet.org, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's new venture to bring Internet access to the global masses.  As it turns out, the previous owner of the Internet.org domain <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/21/internet-orgs-former-owner-didnt-know-he-sold-to-zuckerberg-but-is-cool-with-the-changes/">had no idea</a> to whom he was selling it.

				<title>Facebook Transparency Report: US and India lead in data requests</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Facebook joined <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/">Google</a>, <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, and other tech companies in issuing a transparency report: in Facebook's case, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/government_requests">aggregated counts of the government data requests</a> it received in the first six months of 2013.  

The United States leads the world in requests, with 11,000-12,000 requests covering somewhere between 20,000 and 21,000 user accounts.  The US is also the only country on Facebook's list without exact figures; the company notes that it has "reported the numbers for all criminal and national security requests to the maximum extent permitted by law" and will published updated figures as soon it obtains legal authorization.  

Trailing the United States, with 3245 total requests covering 4144 users, is India, a country that has also ranked high in <a href="http://tech2.in.com/features/general/the-google-transparency-report-and-india/613002">Google's Transparency Report</a>.  The UK, Germany, and Italy round out the top five.

In countries with more than 100 requests, Taiwan received the greatest compliance from Facebook, with 84 percent of requests resulting in at least some data. The United States followed closely behind, with Facebook complying or partially complying with 79 percent of requests.

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/FB_requests_data.png"><img src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2013/08/FB_requests_data-982x1024.png" alt="" title="FB_requests_data" width="584" height="608" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1020" /></a>

The current transparency report reveals only numbers&mdash;unlike in the Google and Twitter reports, no information on the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/08/27/facebook-publishes-first-transparency-report-11000-government-requests-in-us-exceed-google/">types or forms of data requests</a> is provided.  Without this information, it's impossible to tell how many of these requests are related to criminal activity such as robberies or kidnappings (two examples provided by Facebook) and how many are related to broader surveillance programs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>United States</strong>
More news about PRISM broke last week: according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA has either <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html">circumvented or broken most commonly used encryption systems</a>.  This affects both financial and medical data as well as the contents of emails, chats, and other online communications.  <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">reports</a> that Hotmail, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook, among other service providers, may be affected.

<strong>United States</strong>
Following close on <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/28/facebook-transparency-report-us-and-india-lead-in-data-requests/">Facebook's heels</a>, Yahoo! released its first-ever <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/transparency-report/">transparency report</a> last week.  The report covers government data requests from 17 countries, and discloses the total number of requests, the number of user accounts specified in those requests, and the number of requests for which Yahoo! disclosed both content and non-content data, among other statistics.  

<strong>Vietnam</strong>
Earlier this summer, Vietnam's prime minister <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/08/05/imweekly-august-5-2013/">approved "Decree 72,"</a> which prohibits blogs and social media sites from "‘quote[ing]’, ‘gather[ing]’ or summariz[ing] information from press organizations or government websites."  The decree, which effectively outlaws political discussion online, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23920541">took effect</a> on September 1.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>China</strong>
Chinese Internet users, worried about the implications of the country's new <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/09/us-china-internet-idUSBRE9880CQ20130909">anti-online rumor policy</a>, are scrambling to <a href="http://offbeatchina.com/as-beijings-online-rumor-crackdown-intensifies-chinese-bloggers-seek-to-un-verify-themselves">"un-verify"</a> their Weibo accounts.  The new policy, part of a judicial decision made earlier this month, allows Chinese Internet users to be charged with defamation (and sentenced to up to 3 years in jail) if they post a rumor online that is reposted more than 500 times or visited more than 5000 times.  Weibo users with verified accounts&mdash;which indicate that the user, generally a celebrity, is who he or she claims to be&mdash;are asking the microblogging site to remove their verified status in the hopes that this might prevent them from being as easily identified (and potentially charged with defamation) online.

<strong>Germany</strong>
More than 20,000 people <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20130907-thousands-german-anti-nsa-protest">gathered in Berlin</a> earlier this month to protest against surveillance.  Protestors at Freiheit Statt Angst (Freedom Not Fear), organized by a coalition of human rights organizations, political parties, and NGOs, spoke out against the effects of surveillance on <a href="http://blog.freiheitstattangst.de/pm5-sept-eng/">press freedom and human rights</a>, among other issues.

<strong>Vietnam</strong>
Activist Ngo Hao has been <a href="http://en.rsf.org/vietnam-cyber-dissident-gets-15-years-for-13-09-2013,45171.html">sentenced to 15 years in prison</a> on charges of publishing false and defaming information about government officials online and of trying to overthrow the government.  Hao is one of at least 35 bloggers and cyberdissidents currently detained in Vietnam.

				<title>Iran Accidentally Allows Access to Facebook, Twitter for 24 Hours</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, Internet users in Iran noticed that they could <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/world/middleeast/iran-facebook-twitter-access.html?_r=0">access Facebook and Twitter</a>&mdash;the first time the social media sites have been viewable in the country since 2009. Despite the block, Iranians can normally access the sites using a VPN, but Twitter and Facebook users <a href="http://qz.com/124913/iran-opens-up-access-to-twitter-and-facebook-for-the-first-time-since-2009/">reported</a> that the sites were suddenly freely accessible.

On Tuesday, this access disappeared.

Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, who leads Iran's filtering and monitoring committee, <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/09/facebook-and-twitter-access-iran-just-glitch-now/69485/">blamed</a> the sites' temporary accessibility on "technical problems"&mdash;in other words, it was an accident.  Some are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/world/middleeast/facebook-and-twitter-blocked-again-in-iran-after-respite.html?pagewanted=all">claiming</a> that the unblocking was a test to see how citizens would respond, perhaps as the beginning of a greater easing of Internet restrictions in Iran, but Khoramabadi has declared that his office is conducting an investigation to determine who is responsible for the glitch, suggesting that it wasn't entirely government-sanctioned.

For now, Iranians are back to using VPNs&mdash;many of which have been <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-03/11/iran-vpn-block">targeted by censorship officials</a>&mdash;to post tweets and status updates. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Bangladesh</strong>
Late last month, Bangladesh's Ministry of Law approved <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/09/18/bangladeshs-ict-act-stoops-to-new-lows/">several amendments to the country's ICT Act</a> that, among other changes, make posting "fake and obscene" material online illegal. Human rights activists, worried that the amendments will lead to an increase in politically motivated arrests of bloggers and others (earlier this year, the government established a <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/04/01/bangladesh-authorities-go-after-anti-muslim-bloggers/">special committee</a> to identify Internet users deemed to be "anti-Muslim"), are <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/ict-law-under-fire/">urging Parliament</a> not to approve new version of the Act.

<strong>Brazil</strong>
Brazil is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24145662">considering requiring Internet companies</a> to host data collected locally on servers located in Brazil.  The proposed amendment to the country's draft <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Civil_da_Internet">Marco Civil</a> bill is widely seen as part of a backlash against PRISM and other US surveillance programs.  The amendment is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-17/facebook-google-face-brazil-storage-mandate-on-snowden-leak-1-.html">intended to protect the privacy</a> of Brazilian Internet users, but some experts are worried that, because Brazil currently lacks specific data protection laws, a new local data storage policy may actually <a href="http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-330272/">put privacy at risk</a>.

<strong>India</strong>
The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India, is <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/akhilesh-yadav-blames-social-media-for-muzaffarnagar-riots-demands-censorship/1/311199.html">blaming social media</a> for instigating <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24141678">religious riots</a> in the town of Muzaffarnagar earlier this month.  The riots, in which at least 50 were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes, were sparked by the <a href="http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/timeline-of-muzaffarnagar-riots-eve-teasing-incident-led-to-mur-27571.html">murder</a> of three young men involved in a dispute about the harassment of a young woman.  They escalated quickly, allegedly inflamed by <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/41330ca2-210e-11e3-8aff-00144feab7de.html#axzz2fkRpEqev">local politicians</a> intent on manipulating religious tensions for their own gain.  Last week, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Use-of-social-media-to-spread-communal-strife-must-be-checked-Akhilesh/Article1-1126049.aspx">stated at a press conference</a> that social media was used to spread misinformation and hate speech and called for censorship to prevent further bloodshed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>China</strong>
China recently enacted a new <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2013/09/16/imweekly-september-16-2013/">policy</a> that allows Chinese Internet users to be charged with defamation (and sentenced to up to 3 years in jail) if they post a rumor online that is reposted more than 500 times or visited more than 5000 times.  Earlier this month, a 16-year-old boy was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/20/china-detains-teenage-web-post-crackdown">detained</a> under the policy for criticizing local police on Weibo.

<strong>Sudan</strong>
Internet connectivity in Sudan <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/25/sudan-internet-cut-khartoum-protests">dropped to almost nil last week</a>, the result of a suspected government Web shut down in the face of anti-regime protests sparked by the ending of fuel subsidies.  In the absence of Internet access, a group in Khartoum has launched a <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/protesters-are-dodging-sudans-internet-shutdown-with-a-phone-powered-crowdmap">cell phone-based map</a> of crowdsourced data about the protests.

<strong>United States</strong>
News broke last Friday that the NSA has been documenting American citizen's social media connections since 2010.  According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html">New York Times</a>, the data that has been collected "can identify [Americans'] associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Iran</strong>
Iranian president Hassan Rouhani <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/oct/02/iran-president-hassan-rouhani-internet-online-censorship">chatted about Internet censorship</a> with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey last week.  The medium for their conversation?  Twitter itself, which is blocked in Iran.  Dorsey launched the conversation by asking Rouhani if Iranian citizens were able to read his tweets.  Rouhani responded by claiming that he intends to "ensure my ppl'll comfortably b able 2 access all info globally as is their #right," potentially signaling a move toward greater Internet freedom in the country.

<strong>Russia</strong>
According to documents collected by Russian journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, Russia plans to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/russia-monitor-communications-sochi-winter-olympics">monitor both the phone and Internet communications</a> of Olympic competitors and spectators in February.

<strong>Vietnam</strong>
Dissident blogger Le Quoc Quan was <a href="http://www.ifex.org/vietnam/2013/10/03/vietnam_blogger_gets/">sentenced</a> to 30 months in prison and a $59,000 fine last Wednesday.  Quan was arrested last December after criticizing the role of the Communist Party in Vietnam's leadership; he was charged with tax evasion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Belgium</strong>
European Union lawmakers are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/business/international/europe-aims-to-regulate-the-cloud.html?pagewanted=all">ramping up efforts</a> to more aggressively regulate European cloud computing. While these efforts <a href="http://www.internetevolution.com/author.asp?section_id=758&amp;doc_id=268566&amp;f_src=internetevolution_sitedefault">could make computing more complicated</a> for businesses and individuals, lawmakers believe they are <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/10/07/european-cloud-users-could-shun-us-cloud-services-altogether#awesm=~oklI13eUPSWBfk">necessary to protect the privacy of European users</a> from spying by the US and other foreign nations.

<strong>Brazil</strong>
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/14/brazil_waxes_lyrical_on_security/">announced</a> via Twitter that the Brazilian government will develop a secure e-mail system in order to protect its internal communications from foreign spying. The announcement is part of a <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/84016">notable recent trend</a> among countries and global organizations trying to undermine US management and control of the Internet. Rousseff has been a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/brazil-president-un-speech-nsa-surveillance">vocal critic</a> of US web surveillance in the wake of recent revelations regarding US spying. Brazil has also been <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/12/us-internet-control">named as the host</a> for next year’s Internet Governance Summit.

<strong>Uruguay</strong>
At this year’s <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/12/us-internet-control">Internet Governance Summit</a> in Montevideo, Uruguay, the directors of the major organizations responsible for developing and administering Internet standards and resources&mdash;ICANN, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the Internet Architecture Board, the World Wide Web Consortium, and all five of the regional Internet Address registries&mdash;<a href="http://www.internetgovernance.org/2013/10/11/the-core-internet-institutions-abandon-the-us-government/">moved to break from US dominance of Internet governance</a>.  The group released a <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-07oct13-en.htm">statement</a> that called for “accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including all government, participate on an equal footing.”

<strong>United States</strong>
Earlier this month, Freedom House <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-internet-freedom-deteriorates-worldwide-activists-push-back">released</a> its annual report on global Internet freedom: <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2013"><em>Freedom of the Net 2013: A Global Assessment of Internet and Digital Media</em></a>. The report, which looks at 60 countries, found <a href="http://rt.com/news/internet-freedom-house-report-706/">Internet freedom to be on the decline</a>, citing an increasing number of laws controlling Internet content and more aggressive efforts by governments to arrest social media users and online activists. The report also found, however, that Internet activists are becoming better organized and better able to resist efforts toward further regulation. Iceland <a href="http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/iceland-tops-in-poll-of-internet-freedoms/2050714/">ranked highest among countries surveyed</a> in terms of Internet freedom (followed by Estonia, Germany, the US, and Australia), while Iran, Cuba, and China <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net-2013-global-scores">ranked at the bottom</a> among countries deemed “not free.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Belgium</strong>
A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/technology/europe-moves-to-put-online-data-beyond-us-reach.html?smid=tw-share">new measure</a> proposed by European lawmakers could require American companies to get clearance from European officials before “complying with United States warrants seeking private data.” A <a href="http://rt.com/news/eu-data-privacy-nsa-326/">vote on the new measure</a>, which was proposed in response to recent revelations about American spying by the NSA, is scheduled for October 21.

<strong>France</strong>
<em>Le Monde</em> <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/10/21/france-in-the-nsa-s-crosshair-phone-networks-under-surveillance_3499741_651865.html">reported</a> that the NSA collected 70.3 million French telephone records during a 30-day period. In response, the French government <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57608391/france-summons-u.s-ambassador-after-report-says-nsa-swept-up-70.3m-french-phone-records-in-a-month/">summoned the US ambassador</a> to demand an explanation for the NSA operation and to renew requests that the US cease its surveillance and enter into talks regarding protection of personal data. The report in Le Monde was co-written by Glenn Greenwald, the same reporter who <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_FRANCE_NSA_SURVEILLANCE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2013-10-21-05-55-54">originally revealed information about NSA surveillance based on leaks from Edward Snowden</a>.

<strong>Mexico</strong>
A new <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nsa-hacked-email-account-of-mexican-president-a-928817.html">report</a> by <em>Der Spiegel</em> found that the NSA has been systematically eavesdropping on the Mexican government for years, including hacking into the public email account of former president Felipe Calderon. A <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/20/world/americas/mexico-nsa-spying/">statement</a> by the Mexican foreign ministry <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/report-us-accessed-mexican-presidents-email-20629277">condemned</a> the US surveillance operation, calling it “unacceptable, illegitimate, and against Mexican and international law.”

<strong>Morocco</strong>
On October 19, the Moroccan government began <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/10/20/morocco-censors-the-web-collateral-damage-allowed/">blocking a number of websites and social media platforms</a>, including Lakome, one of the country's main independent media outlets. Lakome was believed to be the primary target of the government’s blocking efforts, as the site's editor, Ali Anouzla, was arrested on September 17 after publishing an article containing a link to a video by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Many journalists and advocacy groups have <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/sometimes-link-just-link-free-ali-anouzla">called for</a> Anouzla’s release.

<strong>Pakistan</strong>
Pakistani activists are using Twitter to <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/10/20/pakistani-web-rallies-against-proposed-ban-on-whatsapp-viber-and-skype/">voice their opposition</a> to a <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/pakistans-sindh-province-bans-skype-whatsapp-and-viber-over-security-concerns-427604">three-month ban</a> of messaging apps&mdash;including Viber, WhatsApp, Tango, and Skype&mdash;implemented by Pakistani’s Sindh provincial government (the province includes Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Germany</strong>
German officials <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65044af4-3f15-11e3-b665-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2j1W5kCxl">alleged</a> that the US had monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone for more than a decade. The allegations were based on leaked documents obtained by the German news magazine <em><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-ueberwachung-merkel-steht-seit-2002-auf-us-abhoerliste-a-930193.html">Der Spiegel</a></em>. While the US administration has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/obama-aware-merkel-spying-since-2010-german-report-092009842.html">denied</a> that President Barack Obama was aware of or approved any intelligence operations involving Merkel, the controversy has increased tension between the US and its European allies and has <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/now-germany-wants-its-own-internet-in-nsa-spying-wake-2013-10">provoked calls</a> within Germany to better shield domestic Internet traffic from foreign intelligence services.

<strong>Global</strong>
Google <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/21/google-ideas-uproxy/?a_dgi=aolshare_twitter">announced</a> the creation of <a href="https://www.google.com/ideas/projects/uproxy/">Uproxy</a>, a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that can allow users all over the world to bypass restrictive firewalls by using peer-to-peer connections. The new technology has the potential to <a href="http://rt.com/usa/google-uproxy-uncensored-encrypted-internet-524/">provide uncensored Internet access</a> for activists all over the world.

<strong>Iran</strong>
The administration of recently elected President Hassan Rouhani <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/173077#.Um5lqZSifWp">announced</a> that it is closely reviewing and revising government censorship policies. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/24/iran-relax-book-censorship-culture-minister">review process is beginning with censored books</a>, but statements by Iranian officials suggest that they may also revisit government policies that restrict access to various websites and social media—a goal that is in line with <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/169540#.Um5m7ZSifWo">statements made</a> by President Rouhani prior to his election.

<strong>USA</strong>
A group of nations led by Germany and Brazil <a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/10/24/exclusive_germany_brazil_turn_to_un_to_restrain_american_spies?wp_login_redirect=0">joined together</a> to push for a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/26/us-usa-surveillance-un-idUSBRE99P01D20131026">UN General Resolution</a> to promote a right of privacy on the Internet. The meeting of diplomats in New York represented the first significant international effort to limit <a href="http://rt.com/news/nsa-un-resolution-talks-788/">NSA surveillance powers</a> exposed in recent revelations about American spying. Diplomats are reportedly considering a draft resolution that <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/25/germany-and-brazil-working-on-un-resolution-concerning-nsa-spying/">expands on the privacy rights</a> contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Brazil</strong>
The Brazilian government said it is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/28/net-us-brazil-internet-idUSBRE99R10Q20131028">forging ahead</a> with a plan that would require global Internet companies to store any data obtained from Brazilian users on servers inside the country. While the plan might better protect Brazilian citizens from US spying it could have <a href="http://rt.com/news/brazil-brics-internet-nsa-895/">significant implications</a> for how global Internet companies are able to operate in the future in Brazil and elsewhere.

<strong>Global</strong>
Recently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html">released documents</a> obtained by Edward Snowden reveal that the NSA has tapped into the main communication links that connect Yahoo and Google data centers all over the world.

<strong>Indonesia</strong>
Indonesian government officials summoned the Australian ambassador to respond to reports that the Australian Embassy in Jakarta <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_ASIA_US_SPYING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2013-10-31-06-35-04">“is a hub for Washington’s secret electronic data collection program.”</a>

<strong>Singapore</strong>
A hacktivist going by the name “The Messiah” <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/01/singapore_anonymous_hacks_internet_rules/">defaced</a> a number of websites in Singapore to protest proposed Internet licensing rules that critics have called back door state censorship. In one instance, the hacktivist, who claims to be part of Anonymous, <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/anonymous-hacker-targets-straits-times-website">targeted</a> <em>The Straits Times</em> website writing, “Dear ST: You just got hacked for misleading the people!” <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/07/09/us-deeply-concerned-by-singapore-internet-rules-after-facebook-ebay-google-yahoo-weigh-in/">Other critics</a> of the proposed rules include Google, Facebook, eBay, Salesforce, and Yahoo.

<strong>United States</strong>
A major reform bill was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/29/nsa-reform-bill_n_4175846.html">introduced</a>, designed to rein in the NSA’s spying powers. While the bill boasts bipartisan support, critics were quick to argue that the “reform” bill does little more than preserve the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/feinstein-shows-off-nsa-reform-bill-thats-really-about-the-status-quo/">status quo</a>. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/john-kerry-admits-us-spying-occasionally-goes-too-far/story-e6frg6so-1226751315967?sv=3862298499283278787e3121d3d9e416#sthash.8ciRweQT.uxfs">acknowledged</a> that there have been cases where US efforts to gather information have “reached too far inappropriately.”

				<title>Beautiful and thought-provoking infographics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple weeks ago we tweeted a <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2013/over-300-of-the-best-data-visualization/">list</a> by the KANTAR Information is Beautiful Awards of over 300 of the year’s best infographics and data-visualizations. Since then, we’ve been working our way through the list and thought we’d share a few of our personal favorites. Two of these are directly related to the work we do and one we just had to add because it was so elegant and powerful we couldn't help ourselves.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><a href="http://www.wikipediaworldview.net/">Wikipedia Worldview (WWV)</a></strong></span>
It’s hard to imagine a cooler way to get an immediate sense for the vast amount of information currently available on Wikipedia. The WWV maps Wikipedia georeferences onto a 2-dimensional map of the world in real time. While the overall effect is like looking at nighttime satellite photos of earth—with clusters of light forming around major urban centers—the WWV offers much more than a photograph by allowing you to click on each location and to explore the information on Wikipedia that has been linked to each georeference. Add to that the ability to analyze the language-based distribution of the information, and you can spend hours with this constantly evolving infographic.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><a href="http://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013">U.S. Gun Deaths in 2013</a></strong></span>
All politics aside, this interactive graphic is not only packed with data but is hauntingly beautiful. The simple design turns the individuals lost to gun violence into brightly colored shooting stars—they arc upward in orange threads that turn abruptly to grey at the moment the individual represented is killed. At first the stars launch slowly so that you can read the name and demographic data of the individual signified. The tragic amount of data, however, quickly forces the launch pace to accelerate until the many threads form an eery orange and gray wave in which individual threads are just barely distinguishable.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><a href="http://socialmediatoday.com/timgrimes/1619306/what-happens-online-60-seconds-infographic">Online in 60 Seconds</a></strong></span>
This one has been pretty well circulated but, if you missed it, it’s definitely worth a look. As the title suggests, this infographic captures “everything” that happens online during a 60 second span displaying it all in a neatly presented pie chart that mimics a clock face. Statistics such as 204 million emails sent, 571 new websites created, and 20 million photos viewed convey the richness and immense amount of activity that characterize the ever more complex online world. They also make your own online activity feel like a very small drop in a very large pond. It makes some of us wish we didn’t know our tweets were competing with 278,000 others sent out during the same minute… you should probably follow <a href="https://twitter.com/thenetmonitor">@thenetmonitor</a> to make sure you don’t miss any of them. : )]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Australia</strong>
A group of hackers claiming to be affiliated with an Indonesian branch of Anonymous <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/05/net-us-southeastasia-hacking-idUSBRE9A208V20131105">defaced</a> dozens of websites belonging to Australian businesses with a message reading, “Stop Spying on Indonesia.” The defacements appear to be in <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/11/04/332841/hackers-deface-australian-websites/">response</a> to recent news about Australia’s involvement in US-led surveillance efforts.

<strong>Brazil</strong>
The Brazilian government issued a <a href="http://pesquisa.in.gov.br/imprensa/jsp/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=1&amp;pagina=2&amp;data=05/11/2013">decree</a> that made good on earlier promises to ensure that from now on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/07/brazil_makes_it_official_gov_email_must_be_open_source_onpremises/">government email will be state run</a> and all government data will henceforth be stored in government facilities in Brazil. The move was made as a result of concerns about US spying.

<strong>Iran</strong>
A growing number of high-level Iranian officials are calling for a <a href="http://en.trend.az/regions/iran/2208150.html">lift of the government ban on Facebook and Twitter</a>. The ban has been in place <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/5/iranian-govt-signingontosocialmedia.html">since 2009</a> when social media was viewed as playing a key role in fueling civil unrest.

<strong>Philippines</strong>
Hackers claiming to be affiliated with Anonymous <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/06/anon_philippines_defacement_protest/">defaced numerous government websites</a> to protest alleged government corruption. Five of the hackers were apparently <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/world/philippines/masked-philippines-hackers-arrested-for-cyber-attacks-1.1251470">arrested</a> later while protesting near the House of Representatives. The incident appeared to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/05/net-us-southeastasia-hacking-idUSBRE9A208V20131105">separate</a> from the abovementioned attack on Australian websites by Anonymous-affiliated hackers from Indonesia.

"Measuring Internet Activity," authored by Robert Faris and Rebekah Heacock, explores current efforts to measure digital activity within three areas: infrastructure and access, control, and content and communities:

<blockquote>This paper seeks to describe the conceptual and practical impediments to measuring and understanding digital activity and highlights a sample of the many efforts to fill the gap between our incomplete understanding of digital life and the formidable policy questions related to developing a vibrant and healthy Internet that serves the public interest and contributes to human wellbeing. Our primary focus is on efforts to measure Internet activity, as we believe obtaining robust, accurate data is a necessary and valuable first step that will lead us closer to answering the vitally important questions of the digital realm.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Iran</strong>
A <a href="http://cgcsblog.asc.upenn.edu/2013/11/07/citation-filtered/">study</a> by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication surveyed over 800,000 Persian-language Wikipedia articles in order to <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/how-iran-uses-wikipedia-to-censor-the-internet">better understand</a> how the Iranian government censors the Internet. Censored articles (963 in total were found to be blocked) covered a <a href="http://cgcsblog.asc.upenn.edu/2013/11/07/citation-filtered/">wide range of content</a>&mdash;from human rights issues to sexual topics&mdash;with a particular attention given to information about individuals and/or groups that have expressed opposition to the state.

<strong>United States</strong>
Critics of the FISA Improvements Act, a new Senate bill described by supporters as surveillance reform, argued that the bill would not only “<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/feinstein-bill-nsa-warrantless-searches-surveillance">make permanent a loophole</a> permitting the NSA to search for Americans’ identifying information without a warrant” but also that it “contains an ambiguity that might allow the FBI, the DEA and other law enforcement agencies to do the same thing.” While the <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/11/senate-intelligence-panel-sharply-split-on-surveillance-177654.html">fifteen member Senate Intelligence Committee voted 11-4</a> to approve the legislation on October 31, a recently released <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113srpt119/pdf/CRPT-113srpt119.pdf">committee report</a> reveals that the members of the committee were sharply split on a number of proposed amendments that would have imposed stricter reforms.

<strong>Vietnam</strong>
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) <a href="https://www.cpj.org/2013/11/cpj-petition-calls-for-release-of-blogger-dieu-cay.php">created a petition</a> calling on the Vietnamese government to release imprisoned blogger Nguyen Van Hai. Hai was convicted under a <a href="https://www.cpj.org/awards/2013/nguyen-van-hai-vietnam.php">vague law that bars “conducting propaganda”</a> for writing blog posts on sensitive political topics. He is currently serving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyen_Van_Hai">twelve-year sentence</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Indonesia</strong>
Indonesia <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/indonesia-recalls-its-ambassador-20131118-2xqb8.html">recalled</a> its ambassador from Australia and announced it would review ongoing cooperation between the two countries&mdash;including the position of the Australian ambassador in Jakarta. The move was made in response to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-18/australia-spied-on-indonesian-president-leaked-documents-reveal/5098860">documents released</a> by Edward Snowden that revealed that Australian intelligence operators had attempted <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24952229">to tap the phones</a> of the Indonesian President and his wife.

<strong>Iran</strong>
Iran has <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/21/iran-blocks-cryptocat/#:eyJzIjoidCIsImkiOiJfNnFyaDZ0MzY5M3NxZWd0YiJ9">blocked Cryptocat</a>, “a tool that allows for secure and encrypted chat, and is popular with human rights activists and journalists around the world.” This latest expansion of Iran’s “Filternet” comes <a href="http://www.socialappshq.com/blog/2013/11/22/iran-blocks-internet-freedom/">despite recent promises</a> by President Hassan Rouhani and other high level officials to relax Internet restrictions.

<strong>United States</strong>
The US Supreme court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/11/nsa-spying-challenge-turned-aside/">declined</a> to consider a challenge to the legitimacy of the NSA’s global surveillance operations. The <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/in-re-electronic-privacy-information-center/">petition</a> brought by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) specifically challenged whether the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court exceeded its authority when it ordered Verizon to give all of its telephone metadata to the NSA. The case was the first to reach the Supreme Court since documents released by Edward Snowden earlier this summer shed light on the NSA’s activities. The Court <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/supreme-court-declines-to-stop-verizon-metadata-handover-to-nsa/">offered no explanation</a> for why it declined to hear EPIC’s plea&mdash;a request that was <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/11/18/supreme-court-declines-to-stop-nsa-surveillance/">unusual for being filed directly</a> to the Court without prior lower court action. There are, however, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/11/supreme-court-declines-challenge-to-nsa-on-verizon-records-for-now/">other challenges</a> to the surveillance program that are pending in lower courts and may reach the Supreme Court in the not too distant future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Canada</strong>
Documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that Canada allowed the US National Security Agency to <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/11/27/canada_knew_us_spying_on_g20_cbc_report.html">conduct widespread surveillance</a> during the G8 and G20 summits that were held in Toronto in 2010. It is <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/11/reports-us-spied-at-canada-conferences-2013112871735413374.html">unclear who the specific targets</a> of the surveillance operation were. Both US and Canadian officials <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/28/canada-nsa-spy-g20-summit-report">declined to comment</a> on the new revelations.

<strong>Netherlands</strong>
A seven-month investigation by the Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) found that Google’s policy of combining personal data from the various online services that it provides <a href="http://www.dutchdpa.nl/Pages/pb_20131128-google-privacypolicy.aspx">violates Dutch data protection law</a>. The DPA’s recent conclusions are based in part a new privacy policy that <a href="http://www.itworld.com/legal/384630/googles-privacy-policy-violates-dutch-data-protection-law-dutch-dpa-says">Google introduced in March 2012</a> and implemented, according to the DPA, without adequately informing users about what it would be collecting and why. The same policy is under investigation in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/29/dutch-data-privacy-google-breaks-accused">five other European states</a>: France, Spain, Germany, Italy, and Britain.

<strong>South Africa</strong>
South African President Jacob Zuma <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201311280887.html">signed</a> a Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Bill into law. According to a statement issued by a presidential spokesman, “The act will <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/131127/s-african-president-signs-protection-personal-information-bi">give effect to the right to privacy</a>, by introducing measures to ensure that the personal information of an individual is safeguarded when it is processed by responsible parties.” The new POPI law is designed to <a href="http://www.humanipo.com/news/37362/zuma-signs-popi-bill-into-law/">protect consumers’ right to privacy</a> while not overly burdening online businesses and entrepreneurs who seek to legitimately use their customers’ personal information to provide better services.

<strong>Vietnam</strong>
The Vietnamese government <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/internet-fines-vietnam/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PennOlson+%28Tech+in+Asia%29">issued two new decrees</a> that create new fines for various offenses related to e-commerce and social media. The <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/vietnam-intensifies-online-crackdown/1799714.html">full impact</a> of the decrees remains to be seen. Critics fear, however, that the new commerce fines place undue restrictions on young e-commerce sites. Activists are also concerned that the new social media fines, which penalize “propaganda against the state” and expressions of “radical ideology”, could be used to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/29/vietnam_decree_174_web_freedom/">further suppress online activity and activism</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Brazil</strong>
A senior Brazilian lawmaker said that a vote on a law that would require global Internet companies, like Google and Facebook, to store the data of Brazilian citizens inside Brazil <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/04/us-brazil-internet-bill-idUSBRE9B30UD20131204">will be delayed</a> until next year due to disagreements about the bill’s content.

<strong>China</strong>
Chinese telecom giant Huawei <a href="http://complex.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/12/02/accused_of_cyberspying_huawei_is_exiting_the_us_market#.Up3Uzi0jGYY.twitter">announced</a> that it will no longer be pursuing business opportunities in the US. US officials and lawmakers have regularly accused Huawei of being a proxy for Chinese military and intelligence agencies and have encouraged public and private efforts to <a href="http://www.decryptedtech.com/news/huawei-leaves-the-us">inhibit</a> Huawei’s influence in the US.

<strong>Iran</strong>
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/12/05/iran-arrests-16-internet-freedom-activists/#:eyJzIjoidCIsImkiOiJfNnFyaDZ0MzY5M3NxZWd0YiJ9">arrested</a> 16 cyber journalists and activists “accused of working against the country's national security, having ties with foreign ‘enemy media’ and designing anti-regime websites.” The arrests followed on the heels of <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/21/iran-blocks-cryptocat/">other recent government actions</a> that have infringed on Internet freedom, despite <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/06/iran-social-media-ban/">promises</a> by the administration of President Hassan Rouhani to peel back repressive government policies.

<strong>USA</strong>
Documents leaked by Edward Snowden <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html?hpid=z1">revealed</a> that the US National Security Agency is collecting vast amounts of cellphone location data to track the whereabouts and movements of hundreds of millions of cellphones around the world. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/nsa-storing-cell-phone-records-daily-snowden">wide scope</a> of the newly revealed programs has again raised concerns about privacy and is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/us/politics/documents-say-phones-outside-us-are-tracked.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">likely to provoke</a> further resentment among foreign citizens and governments who have already expressed displeasure with US spying.

The report&mdash;a collection of essays from roughly two dozen experts around the world, including Ron Deibert, Malavika Jayaram, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, Molly Sauter, Bruce Schneier, Ashkan Soltani, and Zeynep Tufekci, among others&mdash;highlights key events and recent trends in the digital space:

<blockquote>To mirror the collaborative spirit of the initiative, we compile—based on an open invitation to the members of the extended Berkman community—nearly two dozen short essays from friends, colleagues, and collaborators in the United States and abroad.

The result is intended for a general interest audience and invites reflection and discussion of the past year’s notable events and trends in the digitally networked environment. Our goal is not to describe the “state of the Internet” in any definitive way, but rather to highlight and discuss some of the most fascinating developments and debates over the past year worthy of broader public conversation.

Our contributors canvass a broad range of topics and regions—from a critique of India’s Unique Identity project to a review of corporate transparency reporting to a first-person report from the Gezi Park protests. A common thread explores how actors within government, industry, and civil society are wrestling with the changing power dynamics of the digital realm.</blockquote>

<strong>The full report and individual chapters are available for download on our <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/annual-report/">Annual Report page</a>.</strong>

<strong>An interactive, full text version of the report is available on <a href="http://h2o.law.harvard.edu/">H2O</a>, where you can remix, share, excerpt, and comment on each essay: <a href="http://h2o.law.harvard.edu/playlists/5125">H2O: Internet Monitor 2013.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>North Korea</strong>
The North Korean government began an effort <a href="http://news.techworld.com/applications/3493815/north-korea-embarks-on-internet-purge-of-executed-official/">to remove all Internet content</a> and references on state-run sites related to Jang Song Thaek, the former top government and party official who was recently executed. Jang, who was the uncle of supreme leader Kim Jong Un, was one of the most powerful men in the country. Since his death, the state has effectively tried to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520616/North-Koreas-leader-Kim-Jong-Un-releases-video-showing-uncle-dragged-parliament.html">erase him</a> from the country’s official history.

<strong>United Kingdom</strong>
Amnesty International <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/amnesty-files-suit-suspected-surveillance-21148535">filed a legal claim</a> against the UK government based on concerns that “the organization’s communications have been unlawfully accessed by the UK intelligence services.” Amnesty’s <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/amnesty-international-brings-claim-against-uk-over-state-surveillance-2013-12-09">concerns</a> first arose following the release of documents by Edward Snowden in June 2013 that revealed how UK authorities had access to information obtained by the US NSA’s previously secret PRISM program—the concerns were amplified when it was revealed the UK’s GCHQ had its own program, Tempora, that may have subjected people to blanket surveillance.  Amnesty’s claim is one in a series of <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131211/07363425530/legal-challenges-to-spying-mount-uk.shtml">recent legal challenges</a> to spying that have emerged in the UK.

<strong>United States</strong>
<a href="http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/889134-gameshttp://www.propublica.org/documents/item/889134-games">Documents</a> released by Edward Snowden revealed that American and British intelligence agencies have infiltrated globally popular online games, such as World of Warcraft and Second Life, in order to <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/world-of-spycraft-intelligence-agencies-spied-in-online-games">conduct surveillance</a> and gather data on game users. The documents suggest that the <a href="http://techland.time.com/2013/12/09/spy-games-the-nsa-and-cia-allegedly-tried-to-recruit-world-of-warcraft-and-second-life-players/">spy agencies were concerned</a> that terrorists might use the online games to communicate, exchange funds, and/or plot attacks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>China & Iran</strong>
Iran's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced this month that it is in talks with China's Information Council about best practices for implementing a closed internal "National Information Network."

<strong>Egypt</strong>
A new anti-terrorism law in Egypt, which will come into effect next month, enables the government to censor websites that <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/01/31/egypts-anti-terrorism-law-to-target-internet/">"instigate terrorism."</a>  Critics of the law worry that this framing could be applied to popular social media sites, including Facebook.

<strong>Netherlands</strong>
After The Hague ruled that blocking access to peer-to-peer file sharing websites such as The Pirate Bay had no measurable effect on piracy, the government of the Netherlands has decided to unblock these sites.

<strong>Russia</strong>
Mashable <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/01/28/russia-internet-olympics/">reports</a> that the Russian government has ramped up surveillance in anticipation of the 2014 Winter Olympics, which begin in Sochi next Friday.  The country's System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM) allows the Federal Security Service to access servers directly, and according to independent reports from within Russia, the government recently has been experimenting with Deep Packet Inspection as well.

"Blogs as an Alternative Public Sphere," authored by Bruce Etling, Hal Roberts, and Robert Faris, uses data collected from thousands of blogs, mainstream media, and TV sources to examine the role of Russian blogs within Russia's media ecosystem:

<blockquote>Applying a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we investigate whether Russian blogs represent an alternative public sphere distinct from web-based Russian government information sources and the mainstream media. Based on data collected over a one-year period (December 2010 through December 2011) from thousands of Russian political blogs and other media sources, we compare the cosine similarity of the text from blogs, mainstream media, major TV channels, and official government websites. We find that, when discussing a selected set of major political and news topics popular during the year, blogs are consistently the least similar to government sources compared to TV and the mainstream media. We also find that the text of mainstream media outlets in Russia (primarily traditional and web-native newspapers) are more similar to government sources than one would expect given the greater editorial and financial independence of those media outlets, at least compared to largely state-controlled national TV stations. We conclude that blogs provide an alternative public sphere: a space for civic discussion and organization that differs significantly from that provided by the mainstream media, TV, and government.</blockquote>

				<title>Iraqi government shuts down Internet access in five provinces</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As violence spreads across Iraq, the government has moved to curb Internet access around the country.

Iraq’s Ministry of Communication issued orders Sunday for <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/16/iraq-regional-internet-shutdown/">a total Internet shutdown in five of the country’s western and central provinces</a>, where violence from a Sunni insurgency led by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is particularly intense.

This comes two days after <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/13/facebook-youtube-twitter-blocked-iraq/">access to Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube as well as communication platforms like Skype, Whatsapp, and Viber</a> was cut across the nation. The government issued the shutdown order to ISPs, asking providers to “shut down the Internet totally,” according to a leaked copy of the ministry’s memo, which Arab citizen media organization Social Media Exchange <a href="http://www.smex.org/iraq-telecom-ministry-orders-isps-kill-the-internet-in-five-provinces/">printed and translated</a>.

The move mirrors other Internet shutdowns in the region. Days after protests broke out in Tahrir Square in early 2011, then–Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered a shutdown that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8288163/How-Egypt-shut-down-the-internet.html">blocked web access in 88% of the country</a>. In Syria, blocks of media sites like YouTube and Facebook were followed by a total Internet shutdown widely credited to President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

The shutdown may be difficult for the Maliki government to carry out, as Iraq’s market for ISPs is unusually fragmented. There are hundreds of providers across the country, some of which offer service via satellite, limiting potential government control. By comparison, <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2011/11/AT_T_Drives_Most_Internet_Traffic_for_U.S._Businesses_in_September_2011">just 10 ISPs were responsible for 69% of web traffic in the US in 2011</a>, according to digital analytics company comScore.

Still, web traffic originating in Iraq has been markedly reduced since the government ordered the access cuts. Renesys, which tracks Internet connectivity, observed two major, hours-long outages before the regional shutdown, first on <a href="https://twitter.com/renesys/status/476092606439768064">June 9</a> and again on <a href="https://twitter.com/renesys/status/477161076178825218">June 12</a>, both of which were <a href="http://www.renesys.com/2014/06/amid-raging-violence-iraq-orders-internet-shutdowns/">confirmed by sources as government-sponsored</a>.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" src="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/files/2014/06/Renesys-12.06.14.png" alt="Renesys 12.06.14" width="1019" height="537" />

The militant group ISIS may be particularly adept at using social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to broadcast its message and recruit new followers. The Atlantic’s JM Berger reports that the group has made use of a Twitter app called The Dawn of Glad Tidings, which it uses to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/isis-iraq-twitter-social-media-strategy/372856/">disperse news and spread messaging via posts to users’ accounts on their behalf</a>. ISIS used Twitter over the weekend to share pictures allegedly depicting the mass execution of Iraqi security forces in Tikrit. The Atlantic reports that there has been a dramatic increase in posts on the ISIS app since its introduction in April, reaching 40,000 in a single day as ISIS marched into Mosul last week—a volume that pushed its posts to the top of results for queries like “Baghdad.” Tikrit and Mosul, the nation’s second-largest city, are both located in states whose web access has been cut.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hong Kong</strong>
On the eve of a referendum about voting rights this week, Hong Kong's digital voting platform was hit by <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/17/hong-kong-voting-site-suffers-massive-ddos-attack-before-civil-referendum/">a massive DDoS attack</a>. Today is the first of three days of voting for Hong Kong citizens, who will decide whether to offer universal suffrage, seen as a move that would weaken the influence of Beijing-sponsored candidates. Now in its fourth day, the DDoS attack is being called "one of the largest and most persistent DDoS attacks in the history of the Internet" by the company <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, which has been contracted to defend the voting platform and said that the attack <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/20/476538/">reached a scale of 300Gb per second today</a>. The attack is widely suspected to be the work of pro-Beijing groups, who oppose the referendum. The vote is unofficial, meaning that its results will have "<a href="http://www.news.gov.hk/en/categories/admin/html/2014/06/20140620_111918.shtml">no legal effect</a>," according to a statement by the Hong Kong government. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/20/us-hongkong-vote-idUSKBN0EV0E520140620">More than 200,000 ballots</a> have already been cast. For more information, see <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2014/06/20/ddos-attacks-in-hong-kong-attack-silence-pro-democracy-websites/">our earlier post on the attacks</a>.

<strong>Iraq</strong>
The spiraling violence as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) sweeps across Iraq prompted the Maliki government to cut Internet access in the country. Last Friday, sites including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/13/facebook-youtube-twitter-blocked-iraq/">were blocked across the nation</a>. Two days later, the government issued orders to ISPs to <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/16/iraq-regional-internet-shutdown/">shut down all Internet access in five of the country's 19 provinces</a>. <em>The Atlantic</em> reported this week that ISIS is particularly effective at using "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/isis-iraq-twitter-social-media-strategy/372856/">gaming Twitter</a>" to push its message and recruit new followers. More information can be found in <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2014/06/17/iraqi-government-shuts-down-internet-access-in-five-provinces/">our blog post about the shutdown</a>.

<strong>Pakistan</strong>
Twitter announced that it would <a href="http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/twitter-restores-access-to-blasphemous-tweets-in-pakistan/">no longer censor tweets deemed "blasphemous" by the government</a>. In a statement, the company said that it had "re-examined the requests and, in the absence of additional clarifying information from Pakistani authorities, [had] determined that restoration of the previously withheld content is warranted." Though hailed as a victory for freedom of expression in Pakistan, the decision drew attention to Twitter's murky takedown policy, which it has declined to make public.

<strong>Tajikistan</strong>
Reporters Without Borders reported that <a href="http://en.rsf.org/tajikistan-youtube-blocked-google-partly-13-06-2014,46438.html">YouTube has been blocked and Google is only partly accessible in Tajikistan since June 12</a>. Blocking has surged in the country over the last two years, usually around times of political tension like last November's presidential election. On Monday, a Global Voices contributor and the publication's former Central Asia Editor, Tajik-born Alex Sodiqov, was detained while conducting academic research in the eastern part of the country. The government has allegedly shown him on national television "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/19/fears-grow-for-canadian-researcher-arrested-in-tajikistan">in an apparent attempt to discredit both him and an opposition politician</a>." More information can be found in our <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2014/06/19/a-scholar-not-a-spy-the-detainment-of-alexander-sodiqov/">earlier blog post on Sodiqov's detainment</a>.

<strong>United Kingdom</strong>
Revelations emerged this week that the British government has been using a legal loophole to scrutinize its citizens' social media communications. Charles Farr, director general of the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism, revealed that posts and other communications made on platforms like Facebook and Twitter <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/17/charles_farr_uk_mass_surveillance_policy/">are considered "external communications" because they're routed through foreign companies</a>. This means that even missives traded by British nationals in the UK, who are usually afforded significant privacy protections, are fair game for government interception—without a warrant—because the data leaves British shores before reentering.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Between Friday, June 13, and Wednesday, June 18, Hong Kong suffered two DDoS attacks aimed at pro-democracy sites.

The targets—one, the site of civil society group <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Central_(2014)">“Occupy Central with Love and Peace”</a>, the other newspaper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Daily"><i>Apple Daily</i></a>—both seek to advocate for universal suffrage in Hong Kong.

Since 1997, when Hong Kong’s period under British control ended and the city-state came under Chinese rule, many of its top officials have been elected by a small group of Beijing loyalists. Occupy Central advocates for a civil referendum that would shift voting power away from these Beijing loyalists and to Hong Kong’s citizenry, allowing them the right to vote in elections that determine who will be Hong Kong’s Chief Executive. Recently, Occupy Central, with the help of Hong Kong University’s Public Opinion Programme (<a href="https://twitter.com/hkupop">HKUPOP</a>), planned to run an online public opinion poll between June 20 and 22 to vote on a referendum on constitutional reforms.

Occupy Central’s three web hosting services suffered violent DDoS attacks; due to the fallout of the incident, only one of these services, Cloudflare, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/06/20/cloudflare-hong-kong-democracy-movement-battling-one-largest-ddos-attacks-history/">still supports the voting system</a>. As a proposed workaround to the voting system’s susceptibility to attacks, Hong Kong University’s Public Opinion Program is now considering using <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/17/hong-kong-voting-site-suffers-massive-ddos-attack-before-civil-referendum/">telephone lines</a> instead, a weak alternative to the online platform.

The second target of the attacks, Next Media’s <i>Apple Daily, </i>is an independent Hong Kong newspaper often critical of Beijing. Its founder, Jimmy Lai, is a <a href="http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/pro-democracy-media-companys-websites-attacked/">vocal supporter</a> of Occupy Central. <i>Apple Daily </i>has encouraged its readers to vote on Occupy Central’s referendum.

The attacks were separately orchestrated. That said, Next Media chairman Jimmy Lai <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/attack-06182014182526.html">suspects</a> that mainland Chinese hackers, eager to suppress Hong Kong’s emerging democratic impulses, wanted to silence two of the city’s most audibly pro-democracy voices through these attacks.

The attacks aren’t limited to Apple Daily and Occupy; they come in a long line of incidents in which pro-Beijing forces, working online, have tried to suppress groups within Hong Kong that are working toward greater democracy. In anticipation of the June 4 anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989—an anniversary that sparked <a href="//arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/china-ramps-up-google-blocking-ahead-of-tiananmen-square-anniversary/">wide</a> <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/06/02/im_scared_to_discuss_tiananmen_and_internet_partly_to_blame">censorship</a> <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/29/china-puts-squeeze-on-wechat-and-other-messaging-apps/">across</a> mainland China—the website of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic movements was also <a href="http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/pro-democracy-media-companys-websites-attacked/">taken offline</a> by sustained DDoS attacks.  In October 2013, Global Voices Advocacy <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/10/26/hong-kong-activists-organize-prepare-for-online-attacks/">anticipated</a> that malicious hacking of civic groups and activist communications like those of Occupy Central would surge approaching July. A similar DDoS attack occurred on HKUPOP’s servers in <a href="http://hkupop.hku.hk/english/columns/columns153.html">March 2012</a>, shortly after HKUPOP held mock elections for the city’s Chief Executive.

Occupy Central and <i>Apple Daily</i>’s founders both feel that Beijing loyalists are undoubtedly behind the attacks, given the subversive, pro-democratic nature of both sites in the wake of increasing tensions between Hong Kong’s pro-democracy supporters and the mainland Chinese government. That said, no particular hacking forces have come forward and taken responsibility for the attacks.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>A Scholar, not a Spy: The Detainment of Alexander Sodiqov</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorog">Khorog</a> is a remote and mountainous Tajik town. It’s situated in the country’s volatile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorno-Badakhshan_Autonomous_Province">Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province</a> (GBAO), geographical and political worlds away from Dushanbe, the country’s capital and political epicenter. Khorog has, in recent years, been regarded as as a hotspot for the festering of anti-Dushanbe sentiment. Since July 2012, it has been a site of deadly clashes between the government and opposition forces. Alexander Sodiqov, a Tajik-born PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Toronto, traveled to Khorog to conduct fieldwork for a project on the role of international actors, states, and civil society in Central Asian conflict management. While there, he met with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alim_Sherzamonov">Alim Sherzamonov</a>, an opposition leader based in GBAO, for the purposes of this research. His research would meet an abrupt end on June 16, when Tajikistan’s State Committee for National Security (GKNB) detained Sodiqov, who is also the<a href="//globalvoicesonline.org/author/alexander-sodiqov/"> former Central Asia Editor</a> for <i>Global Voices</i>.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="800"]<img src="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Sodiqovandfamily.00-800x228.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="228" /> Sodiqov and his family, via <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/19/statement-global-voices-demands-release-of-tajik-scholar-alexander-sodiqov/">Global Voices Advocacy</a>.[/caption]

Though the reasons for his detainment were initially vague, the GKNB soon claimed that Sodiqov was acting on “subversion and espionage.” Sodiqov’s arrest comes amid claims by GKNB officials that foreign spies are enacting <a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68671">“a big geopolitical-ideological game”</a> to destablize the country. Two days after his detainment, Sodiqov appeared on Khorog local state television reading a forced statement subtly disparaging Sherzamanov. Viewers described him as <a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68671">pale and confused-looking</a> in the video. Sodiqov's arrest coincides with the partial <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/06/18/netizen_report_tajikistan_arrests_alex_sodiqov_partially_blocks_youtube.html">blockage of both YouTube and Twitter in Tajikistan since June 12</a>, a move many activists fear is a reaction to public discourse that is critical of President Emomalii Rahmon. The past few years have seen blockages of this nature in spades, from such widely-used social networks as YouTube, Twitter, and VKontakte to independent news agencies and websites. Months ago, in the run-up to the presidential elections, YouTube was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcmediaaction/posts/Social-media-in-Tajikistan-a-battlefield-">blocked after a video of Rakhmon drunkenly dancing at his son’s wedding surfaced online</a>.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">"Alexander is an outstanding young Tajik scholar and not any kind of agent of a foreign government" <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeAlexSodiqov&amp;src=hash">#FreeAlexSodiqov</a> <a href="http://t.co/61wMcWB66l">http://t.co/61wMcWB66l</a> — Advox (@Advox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Advox/statuses/479882336889499649">June 20, 2014</a></blockquote>
Many activist organizations have mobilized to advocate for Alex’s release. Some media freedom advocates have launched the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeAlexSodiqov?src=hash">#FreeAlexSodiqov Twitter campaign</a> to raise awareness of his arrest, while such organizations as Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, and Avaaz have begun petitions and released official statements <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/06/18/netizen_report_tajikistan_arrests_alex_sodiqov_partially_blocks_youtube.html">condemning</a> the detainment. Fellow academics have banded together to form <a href="//scholarsforsodiqov.blogspot.com/">Scholars for Sodiqov</a>, insisting that his academic work was anything but politically-motivated espionage. A <a href="http://www.freesodiqov.org/">website</a> has also been launched to advocate for his release.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The hacker collective Anonymous has launched a series of attacks on World Cup sponsors and other affiliates, stealing data and taking over websites.

On Thursday, Anonymous took credit for taking down sponsor <a href="http://twitter.com/AnonBRNews/status/479740049052139520">Yingli Solar</a>, a Chinese solar power company, as well as breaching the network of <a href="http://www.ehackingnews.com/2012/04/opglobo-brazilian-tv-network-and-other.html">Globo TV Brasil</a>, Brazil’s largest television network, and <a href="http://pastebin.com/2uQ6aRTq">publishing employee details online</a>.

The group has also targeted <a href="http://hackread.com/anonymous-hackers-brazil-worldcup-hacks/">a number of Brazilian governmental bodies</a>, including the <a href="http://operationgreenrights.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-ministry-of-brazilian-environment.html">Ministry of the Environment</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/OpGreenRights/status/479817628169822208">Military Police of Sao Paulo State</a>.

On Friday, Anonymous used a DDoS attack to <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/hackers-take-down-world-cup-site-in-brazil/">bring down the 2014 World Cup site for several hours</a>. Later that day, the group bragged about its alleged conquests: “<a href="https://twitter.com/AnonBRNews/status/479907302926209024">Anonymous 145 x 0 FIFA</a>.”
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpHackingCup&amp;src=hash">#OpHackingCup</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpWorldCup&amp;src=hash">#OpWorldCup</a> partial score: Anonymous 145 x 0 FIFA. The game continues. Expect us <a href="http://t.co/sPiUQxeAHO">http://t.co/sPiUQxeAHO</a> <a href="http://t.co/HOYAz1jwRy">pic.twitter.com/HOYAz1jwRy</a>

— Anonymous Brasil (@AnonBRNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/AnonBRNews/statuses/479907302926209024">June 20, 2014</a></blockquote>
The hacks have been publicized under hashtags including <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpMundial2014&amp;src=typd">#OpMundial2014</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpWorldCup&amp;src=typd">#OpWorldCup</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpHackingCup&amp;src=typd">#OpHackingCup</a>.

The cyber security company Symantec, which tracks cyber attacks, <a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/emerging-threat-anonymous-operation-world-cuphacking-cup">issued a notice</a> on the eve of the World Cup warning potential targets of likely ploys, “including ‘run-of-the-mill’ distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, phishing/spear-phishing emails, intrusion and data-theft attempts, vulnerable software exploration, web application exploits, and possibly website defacement.”

Anonymous has been vocal about its plans to disrupt the World Cup. In February, several alleged Anonymous members told Reuters that they <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/26/us-worldcup-brazil-hackers-idUSBREA1P1DE20140226">planned to go after sponsors as well as the Brazilian government</a> during the tournament, noting that the massive audience would serve as a useful stage to protest the expense of the World Cup games—estimated at $14 billion—in a country where many citizens still lack access to basic services.

In May, Anonymous hackers broke into the Brazilian Foreign Ministry’s computers and leaked confidential emails. Stating that the group had “a plan of attack,” one hacker told Reuters that World Cup sponsors would be <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/05/30/us-brazil-worldcup-hackers-idINKBN0EA29M20140530">Anonymous’s prime targets</a>, naming Coca Cola, Budweiser, and Adidas.

Despite the longstanding threats, Brazil was widely seen as a sitting duck for hackers, in large part because of its aging telecommunications infrastructure. “I don’t think there is much they can do to stop us,” one hacker told Reuters.

Last June, hackers <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/brazil-world-cup-website-hacked-activists-replace-2014-fifa-world-cup-website-protest-footage-video">replaced the FIFA World Cup homepage</a> with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsBff36o-Nk">video</a> showing protesters marching against public transit fare increases, which spurred mass protests around the country. In the video, the protesters, who chant “<em>sem violencia</em>” or “without violence” throughout, eventually encounter a line of police officers, who respond with rubber bullets and tear gas. That month, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Brazilian authorities to <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2013/06/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-restrain-in-brazilian-protests/">rein in their use of force against peaceful demonstrators</a>. In March of this year, officials in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/06/201361821494340354.html">announced the rollback of the cities’ respective fare increases</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2014/06/monitoring-information-controls-in-iraq/">new report from the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto</a> takes a look at Internet monitoring in Iraq. Since violence led by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) broke out in the country several weeks ago, the government has responded by <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/internetmonitor/2014/06/17/iraqi-government-shuts-down-internet-access-in-five-provinces/">cutting Internet access</a>, first by blocking websites including Twitter and Facebook and then, on June 15, issuing orders for a total Internet shutdown in five of the nation's 19 provinces.

Among the report's key findings:
<ul>
	<li>A total of 20 unique URLs were found to be blocked on three major Internet service providers (ISPs): Earthlink Telecommunications, IQ Net, and Newroz Telecom. The blocked sites include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Skype, YouTube, WhatsApp, and WeChat, as well as popular VPN services including OpenVPN and StrongVPN.</li>
	<li>The majority of the websites found to be unavailable corresponded with the list of that the Ministry of Communications ordered to be blocked on June 13. The ISP Newroz Telecom showed no signs of filtering, which "was expected, because this ISP serves the Kurdistan area, and reports have indicated that the shutdown and social media blocking orders did not include Kurdistan."</li>
</ul>

Via the <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2014/06/monitoring-information-controls-in-iraq/">Citizen Lab</a>.[/caption]
<ul>
	<li>The Citizen Lab also looked at seven websites "affiliated with or supportive of" ISIS. None were blocked. "Given that the insurgency was cited as the rationale for the shutdown and filtering," wrote the authors, "this finding is curious." This could suggest that the Maliki government is using the present crisis as an excuse to rein in broader social media around the country—whether or not it is related to ISIS violence.</li>
	<li>Usage of Psiphon and Tor, which allow users to circumvent filtering, has soared in Iraq in recent days (though Tor use <a href="https://twitter.com/Herdict/status/481470132628115456">has since fallen slightly</a>).</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There’s a prison, hidden in the suburbs of Addis Ababa, named <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/04/26/six-members-of-blogging-collective-arrested-in-ethiopia/">Kality</a>. Home to many of Ethiopia’s political prisoners, the prison is divided into eight zones. The last of these zones, Zone Eight, is <a href="//ethioforum.org/letter-to-my-son-by-eskinder-nega-from-kaliti-prison/)">home</a> to detained journalists, human rights activists, and dissidents.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<img src="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-shot-2014-05-03-at-8.40.02-AM.png" alt="" width="400" height="409" /> Free Zone 9 bloggers campaign image.

To some Ethiopian netizens, there is a Ninth Zone – a Zone dedicated to the <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/04/26/six-members-of-blogging-collective-arrested-in-ethiopia/">“proverbial prison in which all Ethiopians live”</a>. In 2012, a group of passionate Ethiopian bloggers launched <a href="http://zone9ethio.blogspot.com/">Zone Nine</a>, a blogging collective that, in its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Zone9ers/info">own words</a>, “blogs because it cares”. Zone Nine <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/03/advocates-ask-african-commission-un-experts-to-intervene-in-zone-9-bloggers-case/">prides itself</a> on providing a counter to the opinions, voices, and attitudes that dominate Ethiopia’s press.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img src="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/zonenine-800x296.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="296" /> The six arrested Zone Nine bloggers; via <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/12/join-the-freezone9bloggers-tweetathon-on-may-14/">Global Voices Advocacy</a>.[/caption]

In April 2014, six of Zone Nine’s bloggers – along with three print journalists suspected of associating with the group – were arrested on the grounds that they were <a href="http://www.thereporterethiopia.com/index.php/news-headlines/item/1931-detained-journalists-bloggers-appear-before-court">covertly receiving money from foreign human rights organizations to incite violence through social media</a>.

63 days have passed since their detention. The bloggers have appeared in court continually over the past few months while being <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/16/54-days-in-prison-and-counting-for-ethiopias-zone-9-bloggers/">detained</a> in Addis Ababa’s Maekelawi detention center. No formal charges have been leveled against them as of yet. That said, activists fear that these bloggers and journalists will suffer the same fate that befell <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/16/54-days-in-prison-and-counting-for-ethiopias-zone-9-bloggers/">Eskinder Nega and Reeyot Alemu</a>, two journalists imprisoned and charged with terrorism (a crime that carries heavy fines and a lengthy prison term) in 2011.

The collective has blogged about numerous political issues affecting the Ethiopian populace, hoping to bolster civic discourse in service of social change. In the wake of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi’s death, for example, Zone Nine <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/04/26/six-members-of-blogging-collective-arrested-in-ethiopia/">penned scathing critiques</a> of Zenawi’s proclaimed economic development achievements, casting doubt on his legacies. They also partnered with Global Voices to launch <a href="http://am.globalvoicesonline.org/">Global Voices in Amharic</a> in 2012, hoping to make international news accessible to local readers.

Since its inception, Zone Nine has amassed a passionate readership within the country. According to its own bloggers, Zone Nine’s stories have occasionally been <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/04/26/six-members-of-blogging-collective-arrested-in-ethiopia/">picked up by wider-known publications</a> within the country, signaling wider support for the messages it has broadcasted. Outside of Ethiopia, the detention of the Zone Nine bloggers has ignited public furor. Global Voices launched a <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/03/4-ways-you-can-join-the-freezone9bloggers-campaign/">#FreeZone9Bloggers hashtagging campaign</a> and organized a FreeZone9Bloggers <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/12/join-the-freezone9bloggers-tweetathon-on-may-14/">Tweetathon</a> on May 14, while UN High Commissioner Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14555&amp;LangID=E">criticized</a> Ethiopia’s increasing frequency of charges against journalists on the grounds of terrorism.

&nbsp;

The arrests arrive in the context of what some activists fear is a growingly repressive media milieu in Ethiopia. For years, journalists – on and offline – have been susceptible to governmental terrorism charges. The Committee to Protect Journalists has <a href="http://www.cpj.org/blog/2012/01/standing-with-ethiopias-tenacious-blogger-eskinder.php">claimed</a> that more journalists have fled Ethiopia since May 2013 than in anywhere else in the world. An ambiguously-worded anti-terrorism law, mobilized in 2009, gave the Ethiopian government the power to act against any form of political dissent so long as it is deemed “<a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/06/30/analysis-ethiopia-s-draft-anti-terrorism-law">supportive of armed opposition activity</a>”. The passage of this law has led to the <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/11/why-blogging-is-a-threat-to-the-ethiopian-government/">arrest and detention</a> of scores of journalists.

Recently, this fight against journalists has moved online, with Ethiopian governmental officials moving to counteract online criticism of their efforts by<a href="http://ecadforum.com/2014/06/07/ethiopia-trains-bloggers-to-attack-its-opposition/"> training blogging recruits</a> to attack any online criticism of the administration (a practice known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>). The government has trained over 230 bloggers since May, teaching them how to post comments that sing the praises of the regime on social media—a particularly interesting move, given that <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/11/why-blogging-is-a-threat-to-the-ethiopian-government/">less than 2% of Ethiopia’s population has Internet access</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laal_(band)">Laal</a> is one of Pakistan’s most popular bands. To the ire of the Pakistani government, it’s known for being vocally, unapologetically secular—so much that the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA), the country’s governing board for telecommunications, <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/15/revolutionary-band-laals-facebook-page-is-now-accessible-in-pakistan-hooray-not-really/">decided to block access</a> to its Facebook page earlier this month. After invoking protest and anger from many netizens, the government lifted the block on Laal’s page.

Similar controversy arose last month arose when the PTA asked Twitter to block access to a number of tweets they cast as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/world/asia/twitter-agrees-to-block-blasphemous-tweets-in-pakistan.html">unethical and obscene</a>. To the PTA, these tweets defied the country’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_Pakistan">blasphemy laws</a>. These ranged from individual tweets, such as ones containing visualizations of Muhammad, to whole Twitter feeds, like that of Duke University pornstar Belle Knox (Knox herself <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/05/27/pakistan-orders-twitter-to-take-down-duke-porn-star/">spoke out against</a> the blocks). Twitter complied with these requests.

The company, which reviews censorship requests on a country-by-country basis, justified the blocks by claiming it was more acceptable <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/twitter-steps-down-free-speech-party">to block specific tweets</a> than it was to block access to the site as a whole. This past week, after <a href="http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201406111324-0023825">encountering civic resistance</a> at home and abroad, Twitter decided to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/twitter-reverses-decision-censor-content-pakistan">restore access</a> to the tweets within the country.

Both cases recall a debate that has frightened media activists in Pakistan in the wake of the Snowden revelations. How do Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, which date back as far as the 1860s, extend to the Internet? To what extent are these laws, steeped in Pakistan’s history, being used to justify censorship?

The answers to these questions have escaped Pakistani netizens for years now. Pakistan’s Penal Code<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_Pakistan"> defines blasphemy in broad terms</a>, and the laws have gone through many iterations dating as far back as the 1860s. For decades, though, civic opposition to the laws has remained strong, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12621225">especially beginning in the 1980s</a>. As Pakistan’s citizens have moved online, these blasphemy laws have been used as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/opinion/pakistans-tyranny-of-blasphemy.html?_r=0">justification</a> for restricting access to tweets, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/christian-couple-sentenced-to-death-for-sending-blasphemous-text-message-9246340.html">Facebook posts</a>, and YouTube videos. They’ve also been used to justify <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/world/asia/68-pakistani-lawyers-are-charged-with-blasphemy-after-protesting-the-police.html">arrests</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/world/asia/pakistani-activist-shot-dead-aided-blasphemy-suspects.html?gwh=3809386083E78180EA51D9B7270B77C1&amp;gwt=pay">assassination attempts</a>, and <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/attack-on-pakistani-journalist-kills-his-driver/?gwh=87A665A2B67FD8EF13B088900D6350F8&amp;gwt=pay">murders</a>.

The initial decisions to block social media content ignited furor and criticism from civic groups both within and outside of Pakistan. Press freedom NGO Bolo Bhi <a href="http://bolobhi.org/pakistan-the-chilling-effects-twitter-country-withheld-pakistan/">questioned</a> the legitimacy of giving the PTA power to call for restrictions of content. Activists both within and outside of Pakistan launched a hashtag campaign, <a href="http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201406111324-0023825?utm_source=DMM%20-%206/13/14&amp;utm_campaign=DMM%205-30&amp;utm_medium=email">#TwitterTheocracy</a>, to mobilize against this censorship. Some netizens <a href="https://twitter.com/Im_Atheist/statuses/476694180191039489">criticized</a> Twitter for abandoning its fundamental ethos of protecting free speech, while others, like<a href="https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/statuses/476483706648289280"> Richard Dawkins</a>, found it curious that Twitter would side with the country’s age-old blasphemy laws.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">The main reason to be on twitter is the freedom of speech. Take that away and it's just another useless application. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitterTheocracy?src=hash">#TwitterTheocracy</a>

— Anakim (@Im_Atheist) <a href="https://twitter.com/Im_Atheist/statuses/476694180191039489">June 11, 2014</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
Is Pakistan really a failed state? Debatable but anyway its absurd blasphemy laws don't deserve support from Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitterTheocracy?src=hash">#TwitterTheocracy</a>

— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/statuses/476483706648289280">June 10, 2014</a>
</blockquote>



&nbsp;

The campaign worked.  In a statement <a href="https://www.chillingeffects.org/weather.cgi?WeatherID=830">reposted</a> on Chilling Effects, Twitter explained that a re-examination of requests prompted the restoration of access on June 17.

To media freedom activists at home and abroad, Twitter’s explanation wasn’t enough. The decision to reverse the restrictions has been hailed, by Bolo Bhi, as something of a <a href="http://bolobhi.org/press-releases/twitter-reverses-blocking-decision-amid-criticism/">minor victory</a>—minor if only because of the ambiguous terms under which Twitter blocked access to the content in the first place.

Media practitioners within Pakistan fear that restrictions of this kind may be due to a new cultural stigma engendered by the Snowden revelations. Snowden’s leaks have led many Pakistani conservatives to cast freedom of expression as a sort of <a href="http://cpj.org/blog/2013/01/pakistans-problematic-record-on-internet-restricti.php">undesirable, neo-colonialist Western conceit</a>. In a letter published by the Committee to Protect Journalists, Sana Saleem of Bolo Bhi explained the damning effects Snowden’s revelations have had on netizens in Pakistan, where the government is trying in earnest to replicate NSA’s model of censorship and surveillance. Pakistan’s government has drafted provisions for an allegedly draconian Cybercrime Law, while the country’s Supreme Court has suggested merging the PTA with Pakistan’s Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), meaning that social media now be understood as broadcast media. This would subject social media to the same monitoring restrictions as those governing broadcast media. This is the precise <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/12/14/pakistans-fight-for-net-freedom/">justification</a> the PTA used in 2012 when it blocked YouTube, after the controversially Islamophobic <i>Innocence of Muslims </i>made its way onto the sharing site.

To activists and media freedom advocates like Saleem, the Snowden revelations have had the opposite desired effect upon freedom of expression in Pakistan. The state and its actors are now more inclined to monitor what its citizens do online, particularly on social media outlets headquartered in the Western world. If Twitter is the least of many evils—some activists<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/twitter-steps-down-free-speech-party"> point out</a> that Facebook and YouTube regularly comply with more pervasive government censorship calls – its country-by-country censorship process is still cause for alarm for many of Pakistan’s media freedom activists.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Australia</strong>
A potentially invasive surveillance bill due to be introduced to Australia’s parliament in July is inspiring <a href="http://en.ria.ru/world/20140623/190673077/Potential-Surveillance-Reforms-Spark-Unease-in-Australia.html">resistance</a> within the country. The bill aims to target potential jihadists and other terrorists who may be spreading violent rhetoric in their online networks. Prime Minister Tony Abbott <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/australian-spy-agencies-in-line-for-new-digital-surveillance-powers">claimed</a> that jihadists who have been radicalized by their experiences with al-Qaeda and its offshoots may threaten national security, spreading their hateful rhetoric online. As such, this bill would give the Australian government power to store public metadata.

<strong>Egypt</strong>
In a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/10/blast-from-past-for-egyptian-dissidents-2013107113914374587.html">climate of political uncertainty</a>, the Egyptian government has sought to extend its hold over its citizenry by creating a <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/21/egyptian-social-media-monitoring-first/">media monitoring software</a> that will understand multiple forms of written Arabic. The system, built to read both colloquial and Romanized Arabic, would allow the government to access the digital footprints of various citizens who may be harboring oppositional thoughts online. Human Rights Watch’ Cynthia Wong <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/21/egyptian-social-media-monitoring-first/">warns</a> that such a move would restrict Egyptian’s netizens from expressing themselves fully and totally online, noting that the Internet has played a significant role in empowering independent voices of reform in Egypt.

<strong>Iraq</strong>
As the reality of stifled internet connectivity <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/iraq-clamps-down-on-internet-1403632792">intensifies</a> in Iraq, netizens are finding cunning ways around these blockages. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opengarden.firechat&amp;hl=en">FireChat</a>, a smartphone app that doesn’t require an internet connection, has seen an <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-24/iraq-internet-shutdown-is-good-news-for-one-app-firechat.html">unprecedented surge</a> in downloads and consumption since June 14. Iraq, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-24/iraq-internet-shutdown-is-good-news-for-one-app-firechat.html">Bloomberg reports</a>, ranks just behind the United States in terms of daily smartphone usage, making FireChat a widely-used form of communication in the country.  A Citizen Lab <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2014/06/monitoring-information-controls-in-iraq/">report</a> released earlier this month also concluded that ISIS filters placed upon websites in Iraq have been largely ineffective, while the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psiphon">Psiphon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a> has increased significantly in the wake of the internet shutdown.

<strong>Russia</strong>
This week, Russia’s Interior Ministry drafted a ten-year strategy to fight extremism – a strategy that could lead to online surveillance of netizens. Extremism is <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/21/russia-says-the-internet-spreads-extremism/">broadly defined</a> under Russian federal law, ranging from hate crimes to armed revolution. The strategy aims to counter politically radical movements from the bottom up, targeting <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/21/russia-says-the-internet-spreads-extremism/">information sources</a> and netizens spreading extremist rhetoric online. News of this plan emerges during a week when Colin Cromwell, Twitter’s head of global public policy, <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/21/russia-claims-to-have-forced-twitter-into-submission-ahead-of-crowells-moscow-visit/">visited</a> Russia and agreed to block “extremist accounts” under the <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/06/23/twitter-russia-censorship-kremlin-roscomnadzor-facebook/">demands</a> of Russia’s Alexander Zharov, the chief of Russian federal communications agency <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Service_for_Supervision_of_Communications,_Information_Technology_and_Mass_Media">Roskomnadzor</a>.

<strong>Thailand</strong>
Since last month’s coup, Thailand’s junta has increasingly clamped down on pro-democracy movements online. For weeks, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/thailands-junta-flexes-its-muscles-online">"liking" of Facebook pages dedicated to anti-coup groups has been outlawed, while numerous pro-democracy websites have been blocked</a>. IFEX reported that the junta is now deceiving netizens into unveiling their personal details through a deceptive Facebook phishing app, through which users are <a href="http://www.ifex.org/thailand/2014/06/25/junta_used_facebook_app_to_harvest_email_addresses/">encouraged</a> to "log in" with their personal information that is stored in their Facebook profiles. This faulty, fake app is in violation of Facebook's own policies, and it was <a href="http://qz.com/226673/the-thai-juntas-latest-crackdown-on-dissent-is-a-bogus-facebook-login-button/">suspended</a> twice by Facebook as a result. Access also reports that the junta has <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/06/26/onlline-crackdown-continues-thai-junta-sets-up-five-panels-to-monitor-media#When:17:49:50Z">recently set up five media monitoring panels</a> that intend to surveil social media for any dissenting opinions.

				<title>“Total Censorship in the Air”: How the Thai Junta Has Policed Online Media</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been over a month since Thailand’s military junta, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_for_Peace_and_Order">National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO)</a>, overtook the country’s government during a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Thai_coup_d'%C3%A9tat">May 22 coup</a>. Since then, the NCPO has aimed to consolidate political control of the country, an impulse that has filtered down to controlling nearly every minute facet of citizens’ public and private life. Citizens in Thailand <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/hunger-games-salute-banned-thailand?_ga=1.173000608.2082720676.1403881989">can’t gesture with <i>Hunger Games</i>-like salutes</a>, nor can they read such texts as <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1538616/protesting-thai-reader-orwells-1984-dragged-police-bangkok?_ga=1.173000608.2082720676.1403881989">Orwell’s <i>1984 </i>and Filipino revolutionary Jose Rizel’s <i>Noli Me Tangere </i>in public spaces.</a> Those acts, the junta claims, are expressions of radicalism.

The NCPO has increasingly moved this strategic policing online. They have ordered Thai ISPs to shut down over <a href="http://www.malaysiandigest.com/technology/502962-thailand-s-coup-spreads-from-streets-to-the-web-219-sites-blocked-so-far.html">200 sites</a>. Some casualties of this call for censorship include <a href="http://prachatai.com/">Prachatai</a>, an independent online newspaper; the Asia and Thailand subpages of the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2014/06/amid-a-coup-thailands-online-crackdown-gains-momentum/">Human Rights Watch</a>, which published an incriminating <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/thailand0511webwcover_0.pdf">report</a> detailing the country’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Thai_political_protests">2010 Red Shirt protests</a>; and Facebook, which was blocked for a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-28/thai-military-denies-facebook-block/5485118">day</a> on May 28 before the NCPO swiftly unblocked it, citing a “glitch” that <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2014/06/amid-a-coup-thailands-online-crackdown-gains-momentum/">activists</a> have chalked up to a social media <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_switch">“kill switch.”</a> When the government tried to set up a meeting with Facebook and Twitter to discuss tactics for censoring anti-junta impulses on social media, the companies in question <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/article/socialmedia-companies-skip-meeting-with-thai-junta-20140529-00684?_ga=1.135138098.2082720676.1403881989">didn’t show</a>.

Police forces have <a href="http://prachatai.com/english/node/4110?_ga=1.139914416.2082720676.1403881989">warned</a> citizens against “liking” any anti-government posts on social media. Last week, news emerged of a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/thai-junta-used-facebook-app-harvest-email-addresses?_ga=1.139914416.2082720676.1403881989">Facebook phishing ploy</a> orchestrated by the government – one in which Thai netizens were tricked into giving their personal information, contained in their Facebook accounts, by being asked to “log in via Facebook.”

<i>Access Now </i>recently reported that the junta is now organizing governmental panels that will surveil all facets of national media, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/06/26/onlline-crackdown-continues-thai-junta-sets-up-five-panels-to-monitor-media#When:17:49:50Z">extending to online media platforms</a>. The junta is offering monetary incentive to those citizens who turn in photos, videos, or other incriminating evidence of people criticizing the junta.

Lisa Gardner of <i>PBS MediaShift </i><a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2014/06/amid-a-coup-thailands-online-crackdown-gains-momentum/">attributes</a> this censorship to the junta’s desire to foster a sense of allegiance towards its regime. For many citizens, the Internet is <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2014/06/amid-a-coup-thailands-online-crackdown-gains-momentum/">largely losing its function</a> as a forum through which netizens can access information, share opinions, and fight against the climate of fear engendered by the junta, whom Gardner claims is trying, in earnest, to convince Thailand’s citizenry of its good intentions.

Writing in <i>Global Voices Bridge, </i>an anonymous Thai journalist <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/31/i-can-feel-total-censorship-in-the-air-internet-freedom-evaporates-in-thailand/">described</a> firsthand the current situation as one in which citizens can “feel total censorship in the air.” The journalist notes that Thailand’s history of military takeovers, such as 2010’s aforementioned Red Shirt protests, saw a similar shutdown of media outlets. This created a political climate in which lack of informational access, coupled with an online media milieu that is curated excessively by Thailand’s junta, led to citizen <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/31/i-can-feel-total-censorship-in-the-air-internet-freedom-evaporates-in-thailand/">compliance</a> with human rights atrocities – a risk the anonymous journalist feels may be presented by the NCPO’s current hold over online communication outlets.
