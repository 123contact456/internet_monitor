Recent research <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/how-censorship-china-allows-government-criticism-silences-collective-expression\">suggests</a> that Chinese censors focus more on content that encourages collective action, rather than all content critical of the government. China has also used “just-in-time” filtering during sensitive events. For example, keyword searches for “Egypt” were blocked on major Internet portals Sina.com during the social unrest in Egypt in 2011, and the 2009 riots in Urumqi led to both a complete Internet blackout in the country’s Xinjiang region and a drastic tightening of Internet censorship nationwide, including the blocking of Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites.</p>","created_at":"2013-11-13T14:38:00Z","id":27,"position":3,"refinery_page_id":10,"title":"Control","updated_at":"2014-01-27T21:02:01Z"},{"body":"<p>Despite heavy content controls that target major political issues that threaten the regime, such as riots in minority groups, the Tiananmen Square Massacre, civic movements, and other forms of collective action, the Internet has opened an alternative space for public opinion in China.

In July 2012 and again in November 2012, the government effectively disconnected the entire country from the Internet.

Fixed (wired) broadband is considered to be any dedicated connection to the Internet at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbps (kilobits per second).

GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current US dollars.</li>\r\n<li><em>Population</em>\r\n<br />\r\nMeasures a country’s total population.</li>\r\n<li><em>Literacy rate</em>\r\n<br />\r\nMeasures the percentage of the population age 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. Generally, ‘literacy’ also encompasses ‘numeracy’, the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2013-12-23T15:21:44Z","id":134,"position":0,"refinery_page_id":32,"title":"Body","updated_at":"2014-01-06T20:01:10Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2013-12-23T15:21:44Z","id":135,"position":1,"refinery_page_id":32,"title":"Sidebar","updated_at":"2014-01-06T20:01:10Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2013-12-23T15:21:44Z","id":136,"position":2,"refinery_page_id":32,"title":"Access","updated_at":"2014-01-06T20:01:10Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2013-12-23T15:21:44Z","id":137,"position":3,"refinery_page_id":32,"title":"Control","updated_at":"2014-01-06T20:01:10Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2013-12-23T15:21:44Z","id":138,"position":4,"refinery_page_id":32,"title":"Activity","updated_at":"2014-01-06T20:01:10Z"}]},{"created_at":"2013-12-19T17:29:46Z","custom_slug":null,"deletable":true,"depth":0,"draft":false,"id":20,"layout_template":null,"lft":29,"link_url":"","menu_match":null,"menu_title":"","parent_id":null,"path":"AFG","rgt":30,"show_in_menu":true,"skip_to_first_child":false,"slug":"afg","title":"AFG","updated_at":"2013-12-19T17:29:46Z","view_template":null,"parts":[{"body":"<p>Afghanistan’s Taliban government banned the Internet in 2001 on the grounds that it was used to broadcast immoral and anti-Islamic material.

But within both categories, it is something of a rare bird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the precise number of Internet users in the country is difficult to calculate, it is clear that a lack of infrastructure, combined with economic and political hurdles, has left access to the global Internet out of reach for most Cubans. But this may soon change. This spring, the country’s only telecommunications firm, the state-owned ETECSA, activated two undersea fiber optic cables that are set to drastically increase connection speeds in Cuba; the firm also opened over 100 cybercafes across the island. Officials have since made public promises to increase access and lower currently exorbitant fees for Internet use. This could fundamentally change the island’s information economy.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2291721\">SSRN: \"Rationing the Digital: The Policy and Politics of Internet Use in Cuba Today\"</a>\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Download the full report as a PDF</em>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>","created_at":"2014-01-27T18:27:47Z","id":187,"position":0,"refinery_page_id":42,"title":"Body","updated_at":"2014-01-27T18:37:56Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2014-01-27T18:27:47Z","id":188,"position":1,"refinery_page_id":42,"title":"Side Body","updated_at":"2014-01-27T18:37:56Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2014-01-27T18:27:47Z","id":189,"position":2,"refinery_page_id":42,"title":"Access","updated_at":"2014-01-27T18:37:56Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2014-01-27T18:27:47Z","id":190,"position":3,"refinery_page_id":42,"title":"Control","updated_at":"2014-01-27T18:37:56Z"},{"body":"","created_at":"2014-01-27T18:27:47Z","id":191,"position":4,"refinery_page_id":42,"title":"Activity","updated_at":"2014-01-27T18:37:56Z"}]},{"created_at":"2014-01-27T18:33:21Z","custom_slug":"measuring-internet-activity","deletable":true,"depth":1,"draft":false,"id":43,"layout_template":null,"lft":20,"link_url":"","menu_match":null,"menu_title":"","parent_id":16,"path":"Research - Measuring Internet Activity: A (Selective) Review of Methods and Metrics","rgt":21,"show_in_menu":false,"skip_to_first_child":false,"slug":"measuring-internet-activity","title":"Measuring Internet Activity: A (Selective) Review of Methods and Metrics","updated_at":"2014-01-27T18:39:29Z","view_template":null,"parts":[{"body":"<p><em>November 2013<br />\r\nAuthored by Robert Faris and Rebekah Heacock</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDEvMjcvMTNfMzFfNTNfNDk4X0lNX01lYXN1cmluZ0ludGVybmV0QWN0aXZpdHkucG5nIl1d/IM_MeasuringInternetActivity.png\" title=\"Im Measuring Internet Activity\" alt=\"Im Measuring Internet Activity\" rel=\"225x255\" width=\"135\" height=\"175\" style=\"float: right; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;\" />“Measuring Internet Activity: A (Selective) Review of Methods and Metrics,” authored by Robert Faris and Rebekah Heacock, explores current efforts to measure digital activity within three areas: infrastructure and access, control, and content and communities:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This paper seeks to describe the conceptual and practical impediments to measuring and understanding digital activity and highlights a sample of the many efforts to fill the gap between our incomplete understanding of digital life and the formidable policy questions related to developing a vibrant and healthy Internet that serves the public interest and contributes to human wellbeing.

Hate speech, praising violence, expressions supporting terrorist organizations, libel, and calling for the destruction of the Israeli state are all expressly prohibited.  In 1945, censorship of the media was legitimized, and the military was authorized to ban the importing, exporting, or printing of material likely to cause damage to the security of Israel. Modern censorship of information operates through <a href=\"https://opennet.net/research/profiles/israel\">voluntary agreements</a> between the military and the Israeli Committee of Daily Newspaper Editors. Even though these agreements lack full consent from media in the country, all media organizations operating in Israel must abide by the censor's decisions. Despite these limitations on free press and free speech, Israel has not yet established an explicit policy of filtering the Internet. Several groups, including the Ultraorthodox Party Shas, have <a href=\"http://2jk.org/english/?p=86 Several\">introduced Internet censorship legislation</a> without success. Private filtering companies provide “Kosher” content blocking equipment for personal homes or private institutions specifically designed for Israeli users, but it is difficult to determine how popular these services have become in Israel. Open Net Initiative testing on Israel's five Internet Service Providers in 2009 found that ISPs offer voluntary filtering for sexual content and sites considered to be immoral.
